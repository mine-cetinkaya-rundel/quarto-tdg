### Rendering

Use the ![](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/images/rstudio-render-button.png){width="30" height="25"} **Render** button in the RStudio IDE to render the file and preview the output with a single click or keyboard shortcut (⇧⌘K).

If you prefer to automatically render whenever you save, you can check the Render on Save option on the editor toolbar.
The preview will update whenever you re-render the document.
Side-by-side preview works for both HTML and PDF outputs.

## JupyterLab

-   ipynb vs. qmd: from now on Quarto document usually means qmd but things translate to ipynb -- orient for qmd-specific language throughout book and how that translates to ipynb \* and maybe another chapter somewhere specifically about this if this gets too long

## VSCode

## Choosing a tool

-   whatever you already use
-   one possible criterion: visual editor with various tools and mention how it will be called out

# Cross-references {#sec-figtab-crossref}

You'll start by diving into the two required step to cross-reference a figure or table:

1. Give your figure or table an identifier that Quarto recognizes as a cross-reference, this means that it starts with `fig-` or `tbl-`.

2. Refer to your figure or table using the syntax `@ID`.

Then, you'll learn about creating sub-references. 

This chapter focuses on creating and using cross-references. 
If you are interested in customizing the way your figures and tables are numbered or labeled see @sec-figtab-captions.

## Adding an identifier to a figure or table

Depending on how you create your figure or table, there are three ways to add an identifier that Quarto recognizes for cross-referencing:

* **Non-computational**: as an ID attribute, starting with `#`, in markdown syntax
* **Computational**: as `label` code cell option in a computational code cell
* **Both**: as an ID attribute, starting with `#`, in the fenced div syntax

We illustrate each of these for figures in @fig-id-figure, and tables in @fig-id-table.
The caption, and alternative text for figures, are optional, but you'll generally include them, so our examples do too.

Ways to add the identifier `tbl-id` to a table.

For figures and tables you'll usually use the prefixes `fig-` and `tbl-` respectively, but see @sec-crossreferences for other available prefixes.
For working examples of computational figures and tables with cross-references see @sec-computational-figures-tables

## Anything can be a "Figure"

Quarto doesn't care what the content of the fenced div is. 
You can put anything inside: an image, a code block, a tabset, a table, markdown etc. 
The label prefix determines how Quarto labels it.
For example, using `fig-` gets you a "Figure X" regardless of the content.

## Referring to a figure or table

To refer to the an output, use an `@` followed by the identifier (@fig-crossref-inline-syntax).
When rendered the cross-references are replaced with the figure or table counter and become links (@fig-crossref-inline-rendered).
In HTML formats, hovering on the links also shows a preview of the figure or table.

::: {#fig-crossref-inline layout-ncol="2"}

::: {#fig-crossref-inline-syntax}
```markdown
See table @tbl-id. 
@fig-id shows ...
```
:::


:::{#fig-crossref-inline-rendered}
![](images/figure-table-simple.png){.border .p-3 fig-alt="Rendered cross-references to a figure and a table shows the text 'See Table 1. Figure 1 shows...', where 'Table 1' and 'Figure 1' are clickable links."}

## Cross-references are within document only

Cross-references are generally limited to the figures and tables within the same document.
The one exception is a Quarto book project---this is your best option if across document (i.e. chapter) cross-references are important to you.
For documents in a webpage project, an alternative approach is to link to the figure or table identifier, as explained in the @sec-websites-anchors.

:::

## Sub-references

Sub-references allow you to refer to specific parts of a multi-part figure or table.

There are some special cases @sec-multiple-figures @sec-multiple-tables 

Generally, nest cross-referenceable element inside a parent fenced div.

````markdown
::: {#fig-parent}

![](){#fig-child1}

![](){#fig-child2}

Overall caption
:::
````


Otherwise most explicit syntax is to nest fenced divs.

# Cross-references {#sec-figtab-crossref}

To cross-reference a computational figure or table you need to:

1. Label your figure or table in a way that Quarto recognizes as a cross-reference, this means using a label that starts with `fig-` or `tbl-`.

2. Refer to your figure or table using the syntax `@LABEL`.

## Adding a label

TODO: generalize for non-computational figures and tables too.

The two examples in @sec-figtab-basic, @fig-tables and @fig-figures,  used the labels `tbl-species-count` and `fig-scatter`. 

### Fenced div

::: {.callout-tip}

## Anything can be a "Figure"

Quarto doesn't care what the content of the fenced div is. Put anything, code cell, tabset, table, markdown. Label prefix determines caption title.

## Referring to a figure or table

To refer to these outputs you could use, for example,:

```{.markdown .code-overflow-wrap}
Most penguins were Adelie (@tbl-species-count). @fig-scatter shows quite distinct clustering of the three species in bill length versus depth.
```

When rendered the cross-references are replaced with the figure or table identifier and become links.

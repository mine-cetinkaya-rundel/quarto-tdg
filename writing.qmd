# Writing content {#sec-writing}

Beyond the document header and executable code cells, the content of a Quarto document is written in markdown.
But not just any flavor of markdown, Quarto's own flavor called **Quarto markdown**.
In this chapter, you'll learn just enough about Quarto markdown to get you writing simple documents right away. 
We'll tease you with some of the rich content you can create with Quarto markdown, but delay a comprehensive coverage of things like equations, cross-references, citations, callouts, figures and tables to @sec-authoring.

## Basics

Markdown is a plaintext syntax for describing document structure.
Here's some example markdown in a Quarto document:

```` {.markdown filename="document.qmd"}
## My First Section

This is the first paragraph with some **bold text** and *italic text*.
You can also include `code` to show function names or variables.

Here's a second paragraph with a [link to Quarto](https://quarto.org).
You might also want to use *italic text* for emphasis.
````

Markdown is a popular format, so the syntax above may be familiar.
You've likely used it if you've opened an issue on Github, or formatted some text in a Discord post.
However, as markdown's popularity has grown, so has the number of variants, or flavors, of the syntax.

The example above illustrates components of markdown syntax that are common across many markdown variants:

* Headings: text prefaced by one or more hashes (`#`), surrounded by blank lines.

* Paragraphs: text separated by blank lines.

* Bold: text surrounded by `**`

* Italic: text surrounded by `*`

* Code: text surrounded by `` ` ``

* Links: text inside square brackets (`[]`) followed by a URL in parentheses (`()`)

When rendered the structure described by markdown is translated to the relevant components in the target format, e.g. HTML tags for `format: html`, or Typst functions for `format: typst`.

## Features of Quarto markdown

Describing basic document structure, like headings and paragraphs, and simple text formatting is enough to get started with Quarto. 
But you may soon be looking for richer content like tables, figures, code blocks, citations, and cross-references.
Adding these components is a matter of adding the appropriate Quarto markdown.
As a teaser, here's an example contains a callout and a cross-reference:

````{.markdown filename="document.qmd" .code-overflow-wrap}
{{< include _examples/writing/features/document.qmd >}}
````

It is important to remember that Quarto markdown is a specific flavor of markdown---although it shares much of its syntax with other variants you shouldn't expect a component of any arbitrary markdown variant to work with Quarto.

The above example illustrates two pieces of syntax you'll see often in Quarto markdown that you might not have seen in other variants:

* Attributes: additional metadata for a component specified inside curly braces, e.g the `{#fig-repsonse}` on the image. You'll see lots of examples in @sec-authoring, and can specifically learn more in @tip-attributes.

* Fenced divs: blocks of content inside colon delimited sections, often with attributes attached, e.g. the callout:
  
  ```markdown
  ::: {.callout-caution}
  Content
  :::
  ``` 

  Fenced divs are used in Quarto to implement lots of different block level treatments: callouts, figure or table panels, and complex layouts.

@sec-authoring covers the most useful features of Quarto markdown in more detail.

## Things to watch out for

### White space matters (sometimes)

You can often ignore whitespace when you are writing Quarto markdown.
For example, extra spaces inline with text are ignored, as are newlines within a paragraph.
That is, the following markdown snippets are equivalent:

::: {layout-ncol=2}

``` {.markdown}
A sentence  with   weird     spacing.   And    another.
This is on a new line.
```

```{.markdown}
A sentence with weird spacing. And another. This is on a new line.
```

:::

However, there are some places white space is important:

* **Blank lines**: you must have a blank line before the items in a list, and before a code block or cell. Without the blank line, Quarto won't identify the component correctly, so you'll get list items that all appear on a single line, or a code block syntax (the `` ``` ``) showing up in the rendered document.

* **Indentation**: items in a list need consistent indentation. Problems with indentation most often occur when an item has multiple paragraphs, or contains something like a code block. You'll notice that your items don't seem properly aligned in the output (usually not enough indentation), or something suddenly looks like a code block (usually too much indentation).

If your content isn't rendering as expected, double-check your use of whitespace.

### The difference between code blocks and code cells

There is a distinction between:

* **Code cells**, sometimes also called **code chunks**, are code that will be executed and replaced with computational output. Code cells use the syntax:

    ````markdown
    ```{{r}}
    # Code to be executed
    ```
    ````

    Code cells are the subject of the next chapter, @sec-code

* **Code blocks** are code that should be syntax highlighted but simply displayed, not executed. Code blocks use the syntax:

    ````markdown
    ```{.r}
    # Code to be displayed
    ```
    ````

    Or the syntax:

    ````markdown
    ``` r
    # Code to be displayed
    ```
    ````

    You'll can more about code blocks in @sec-code-blocks.

The syntax difference, as little as a `.`, means it is easy to mistake one for the other in your document.
However, the differences in behavior are huge---code cells are handled by the computational engine, code blocks are not. 
When you are reading examples, or trouble-shooting your own documents, keep that distinction in mind and be wary of trying to apply solutions for code blocks to code cells and vice versa.

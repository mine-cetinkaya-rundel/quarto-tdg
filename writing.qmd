# Writing content {#sec-writing}

This chapter covers the essentials of writing content in Quarto using markdown.
You'll learn to structure your document with headings, create paragraphs and lists, format text, and include images and basic tables.

For more advanced authoring features equations, cross-references, citations, callouts, layout, computational figures and tables see @sec-authoring.

## Markdown text

Everything that isn't the document header or an executable code cell is interpreted as Quarto markdown.
Quarto markdown inherits much of Pandoc's markdown syntax, but uses its own parser.
This means you can use familiar markdown syntax, though there are some differences from Pandoc.
The rest of this chapter outlines the most useful Quarto markdown syntax.


## Sections

Use markdown headings to structure your document into sections and subsections.
Markdown headings are created by prefixing text with one or more `#` characters,
followed by a space, and the heading title:

```markdown
## Section

### Subsection

#### Subsubsection

```

Quarto supports six levels of headings, from level-1 (`#`) to level-6 (`######`).
The value of `title` in the document header usually becomes the level-1 heading of the document,
which is why sections usually start with level-2 headings.

You can attach attributes to headings by adding curly braces `{}` after the heading text.
For example, you might add an identifier to a section heading to enable cross-referencing:

```markdown
## Section Title {#sec-section-title}
```

Or you might add a class like `.unlisted` to exclude a section from the table of contents:

```markdown
## Section Title {#sec-section-title .unlisted}
```

::: {#tip-attributes .callout-tip}

## What are attributes?

Attributes are a way to add metadata to markdown elements, usually inside curly braces `{}` after the element.
Attributes are used extensively in Quarto to control the behavior or appearance of many elements.

The types of thing you can add as attributes include:

* Identifiers (IDs), should be unique and start with `#`
* Classes start with `.`
* Key-value pairs use `key='value'` syntax.

The order of attributes matters: identifiers must come first, followed by classes, and then key-value pairs.

## Paragraphs

Create paragraphs by separating text with blank lines:

```markdown
This is the first paragraph. It can span multiple lines
in your source document.

This is a second paragraph, separated by a blank line.
```

Quarto ignores line breaks within a paragraph, which means you can wrap your text across multiple lines without affecting the final rendered output.

## Text

Beyond plain text, @tbl-inline-text-elements summarizes the most common things you want to put inside a paragraph or heading: formatted text, links, cross-references, citations, math and footnotes.

These elements are called **inline text elements**, because they are used inline with text, inside what are called **block elements** like paragraphs and headings.
You can also use them inside many of the other block-level elements discussed in this chapter like as list items, inside tables, and inside callouts.

## Lists

You can create an unordered list by starting each line with `-` (or `*` or `+`) followed by a space,
ensuring there is a blank line before the first element:

```markdown
My list:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

Leaving no blank lines between items will result in a compact list, while leaving a blank line between items will create a loose list with more vertical spacing.

Use numbers followed by a period to create an ordered list:

```markdown
My numbered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

The actual numbers you use doesn't matter---Quarto will renumber the list automatically.
You could use `1.` for every item if you prefer.

List items can contain other block elements like paragraphs, code blocks, or even other lists.
Subsequent elements should be indented to line up with the first non-space content after the list marker.
@fig-nested-list shows an example of a nested list, along with its rendered output.

::: {#fig-nested-list}

::: {}
````markdown
{{< include _examples/authoring/lists/nested.md >}}
````
:::

:::{}
::: {.rendered style="text-align: left;"}

Quarto also supports task lists and definition lists.
See the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#lists) for details on these specialized list types.


## Images and figures {#sec-markdown-figures}

You can include images in your document either from an image file, or from the output of an executable code cell.

Figures are so important in Quarto documents that we dedicate an entire part of this book to them.
For more details, see @sec-figtab.

::: {.callout-tip}

## Image or figure?

We use the term **figure** to refer to any image, numbered or not, included in a document.
You may be more used to using the term figure to refer to an image with a numbered caption---we'll call this a **cross-referenceable figure**.

:::

### From a file

To include an image file in markdown you use the following syntax:

```markdown
![](path/to/image.png)
```

Where the path to the image is a path relative to the current document.

::: {.callout-tip}

## Project relative paths

If you preface the path with `/`, it is interpreted as a path relative to the project root.
You'll learn more about project structure in [Projects](#sec-projects).

:::

You can add a caption inside the square brackets, an identifier inside curly braces after the image path, and alternative text for accessibility in a `fig-alt` attribute:

```markdown
![Caption](path/to/image.png){#fig-quarto fig-alt="Alternative text"}
```

If your identifier starts with `fig-`, the image will be a cross-referenceable figure, numbered, and can be referenced using the `@` syntax.

### From a code cell {#sec-computational-figure}

If the output from an executable code cell is an image, it will be automatically included in your document.
To add an identifier, caption, or alternative text use the code cell options `label`, `fig-cap`, and `fig-alt` respectively:

````markdown
```{{LANGUAGE}}
#| label: fig-quarto
#| fig-cap: "Caption"
#| fig-alt: "Alternative text"

# Code that generates a plot
```
````

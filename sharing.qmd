# Sharing Your Work {#sec-sharing}

When we talk about *publishing* Quarto documents, we usually mean making the rendered documents available to others via the web.
In this chapter, you'll learn the basics of Quarto's built-in tools for publishing your content.
For more details on specific providers and other ways to share documents, see @sec-publishing.

## Publishing to the web {#sec-publish-web}

The quickest way to publish a single document is via the `quarto publish` command, providing the document filename as an argument:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto publish document.qmd
```

The command will prompt you to select a **Provider**:

```
? Provider:
❯ Quarto Pub
  GitHub Pages
  Posit Connect
  Netlify
  Confluence
  Hugging Face Spaces
```

You'll learn a bit more about the providers later in this chapter, but let's use Quarto Pub for illustration.

[Quarto Pub](https://quartopub.com) is a free service.
To follow along, you'll need to [**Sign Up**](https://quartopub.com/sign-up) for an account first.
:::

Quarto will prompt you to authorize your account when you select a Provider for the first time.
This looks different for each provider, but for Quarto Pub, you'll be asked to authorize your account via your default internet browser:

```
? Provider: › Quarto Pub
? Authorize (Y/n) ›
❯ In order to publish to Quarto Pub you need to authorize your account.
  Please be sure you are logged into the correct Quarto Pub account in your
  default web browser, then press Enter or 'Y' to authorize.
```

Once authorized, Quarto will ask you to confirm the document title.
Then Quarto will render your document one more time, before sending it (and all its required resources) to the Provider.
Once done, a browser will open to view your published content, as shown in @fig-quartopub.

## Your view depends on whether you are logged into Quarto Pub

If you aren't logged in to Quarto Pubs your browser will open to the public URL, rather than the site administration view shown in @fig-quartopub.
:::

Pages published on Quarto Pub have public URLs of the form: `{ username }.quarto.pub/{ document_title }/`.
You can share the URL and anyone can view your rendered content.

## The publishing process {#sec-publishing-process}

The `quarto publish` command relies on local rendering — that is, your Quarto documents are rendered locally on your computer using your local installation of the Quarto CLI. Only the output files are then transferred to the publishing provider.
In @fig-pub-process we illustrate this as two separate steps—render then publish— but they both occur when you run the `quarto publish` command.

![The `quarto publish` process. Input files are rendered locally, then the output files and their dependencies are uploaded to the publishing provider.](images/publishing-process.jpg){#fig-pub-process fig-alt="A diagram of the publishing process. An arrow labeled Render points from a file with extension .qmd to a collection of files including one with extension .html, a folder labelled _files/ and a file with extension .jpg. An arrow labelled publish points from this collection of files to the same collection of files on quartopub.com."}

Quarto generates a single self-contained output file for some output formats, like PDF or Word documents.
This single output file is the only thing that needs to be transferred to the provider to share it with others.
However, for some formats, notably HTML, Quarto generates a collection of files, which might depend on other local files like images.
All of these files and their dependencies need to be transferred to the provider to publish the content successfully.
The advantage of `quarto publish` is that Quarto identifies all these required files for you.

## Updating published documents

When you use `quarto publish` details about what and where you publish are stored in a file called `_publish.yml`:

``` {.yaml filename="_publish.yml"}
- source: hello.qmd
  quarto-pub:
    - id: 8f059af6-06e1-4594-b7b0-252dab8c0d9e
      url: 'https://quartopub-test.quarto.pub/test'
```

This means when you run `quarto publish` on a document or project a second time, you'll be given the option of using the same details---in effect updating your published content.

The details in `_publish.yml` aren't sensitive (there are no authentication details) so you can check it into version control.

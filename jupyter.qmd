# Jupyter {#jupyter}

If you're a JupyterLab or Jupyter ecosystem user, you can use Quarto to render your .ipynb files.

You'll need to execute the code cells individually or run all cells in the Jupyter interface before rendering with Quarto.

There's a flag you can put on `quarto render` that will execute code cells in .ipynb files.

You can convert from .ipynb to .qmd, get plain-text version of your document that is easy to version control, and convert back to .ipynb when needed with `quarto convert`.

Everything else will be in markdown cells. Code in code cells, code cell options declared on top of the code cell with `#|`.

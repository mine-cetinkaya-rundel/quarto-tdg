# Reboot

A restructured book with progressive depth, plus basic format coverage.

## Working titles

* "Quarto Essentials"
* "Quarto: the Practical Guide" 

## Timeline

* Mid-Jan: Existing content restructured
* Late-Jan: Tools chapter merged in
* Feb: Opt-in to new quarto markdown syntax
* Late-March/early-April: First draft complete
* Summer: reviews, revisions, final production

## Target Audience

New Quarto users who want to learn Quarto systematically. The book takes readers from zero to competent, with enough depth to work independently. Not a quick-start guide, but not an exhaustive reference either.

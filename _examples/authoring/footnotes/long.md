Here is some text that needs a long footnote.[^longnote]

[^longnote]: Here's the footnote contents with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

    ```{.r}
    # Some code
    ```

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.

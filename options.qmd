# Setting Options {#sec-options}

Throughout this book, you've been setting options to control how your documents look and behave.
You've set a document title in the header, specified an output format, and controlled whether code is displayed in your output.
These options all use the same underlying syntax: YAML.

This chapter makes that syntax explicit.
You'll learn the three places where you can set options and the essential YAML syntax rules you need to write them correctly.
For the full details of YAML syntax and troubleshooting tips, see @sec-yaml.

## Three places to set options

There are three places you'll commonly set options: in the document header, under a format key, and in code cells.

### Document header

The document header is the YAML block at the top of your `.qmd` file, enclosed by `---`.
Options set here apply to the entire document:
```yaml
---
title: My Document
author: Jane Doe
date: 2024-01-15
---
```

Options like `title`, `author`, and `date` apply regardless of the output format.

### Under a format key

Some options are specific to a particular output format.
To set these, nest them under the format name:

```yaml
---
title: My Document
format:
  html:
    toc: true
    code-fold: true
---
```

Here, `toc` and `code-fold` are options specific to HTML output.
The indentation shows that these options belong under `html`, which belongs under `format`.

### Code cell options

Code cell options control the behavior of individual code cells.
They appear at the top of the cell, each on its own line starting with `#|`:

```{{r}}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

# Your code here
```

These options affect only the cell they appear in.
Common options include `echo` (whether to show the code), `eval` (whether to run the code), and `warning` (whether to display warnings).

## YAML syntax essentials

All three places use YAML syntax.
Here are the essential rules you need to know.

### Key-value pairs

Options are written as key-value pairs separated by a colon and a space:

```yaml
title: My Document
```

The space after the colon is required---`title:My Document` won't work.

### Indentation matters

YAML uses indentation to show structure.
When options are nested, indent them consistently:

```yaml
format:
  html:
    toc: true
```

Use spaces for indentation, not tabs.
Two spaces per level is the convention, but the exact number doesn't matter as long as you're consistent.

### Arrays

Some options accept multiple values.
There are two ways to write arrays in YAML.

**Bracket syntax** puts all values on one line, separated by commas:

```yaml
theme: [cosmo, custom.scss]
```

**Dash syntax** puts each value on its own line, prefixed with a dash:

```yaml
theme:
  - cosmo
  - custom.scss
```

Both are equivalent---use whichever you find more readable.

### When you need quotes

Most values don't need quotes, but you'll need them when your value contains special characters like `:` or `#`:

```yaml
title: "My Report: 2024 Edition"
subtitle: "#QuartoTips"
```

You'll also need quotes if your value looks like a number or boolean but should be treated as text:

```yaml
version: "2.0"
code: "true"
```

Without quotes, `2.0` would be interpreted as a number and `true` as a boolean.

## Getting help from your IDE

If you're using RStudio, VS Code, or Positron with the Quarto extension, your editor can help you write YAML correctly.

**Completion** suggests valid option names and values as you type.
This helps you discover what options are available and avoid typos.

**Validation** highlights errors in your YAML, such as incorrect indentation or invalid values.
Look for squiggly underlines or error markers in the gutter.

When things go wrong and you're not sure why, see @sec-yaml for troubleshooting tips and a deeper understanding of YAML syntax.

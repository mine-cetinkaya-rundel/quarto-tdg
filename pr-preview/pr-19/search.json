We’ll start from the basics and build up your understanding step by step.\nIf you have some experience with Quarto already, this book will help you fill in gaps in your foundational knowledge and give you broader exposure to Quarto’s capabilities. You might have learned Quarto by solving specific problems as they arose; here we present a more systematic approach.\nYou don’t need to be an R or Python user to benefit from this book. While Quarto excels at integrating code and output, it’s also a powerful modern approach to typesetting that works across multiple formats. If you’re interested in creating professional documents, presentations, or websites without writing code, Quarto can help you separate your content from its appearance and easily generate the same material in different formats.",

It reflects what we think is the right order to learn Quarto: first, nail down your workflow and tools, then learn Quarto’s specific flavor of markdown, followed by integrating computation, and finally, Quarto projects.\nYou can read this book away from your computer. While we encourage you to try examples as you go, we’ve written the book so you can learn concepts and understand how Quarto works even when you’re not actively coding.\nWe’ve curated both the path through the material and the level of detail. We focus on the most important concepts and features—the ones you’ll use regularly—rather than trying to cover everything Quarto can do. We’ve also filled in explanatory gaps that the official documentation sometimes leaves.\n\nThe official Quarto website at quarto.org remains the definitive reference. We’ll point you there for specific details that aren’t of general interest, or when you’re ready to track down more advanced features. The official site also includes step-by-step tutorials that are excellent when you want a hands-on introduction to specific tasks.",

This part covers foundational knowledge that applies regardless of how you plan to use Quarto.\nPart II focuses on Computation. Most readers will be interested in at least one of chapters 7  Quarto and R, 8  Quarto and Python or ?sec-julia. However, if you don’t plan to include any computational content in your Quarto documents, you can skip this entire part. If you do work with code, read the relevant language-specific chapters along with the rest of Part II.\nPart III covers Output formats. Everyone will want to read some chapters from this part based on their needs and interests. You can dip into these chapters in any order—if you need to create presentations, jump straight to that chapter. Each chapter is designed to be read from start to finish, but you don’t need to read every chapter in the part.\nPart IV, Doing more with Quarto, ventures into advanced, optional territory. Once you’re using Quarto for the majority of your work and you bump up against limitations you’d like to overcome, return to this part.

A few of the key features of Quarto that are applicable to Quarto users at any level are listed below:\nThe best place to learn about Quarto and explore its capabilities, aside from this book, is quarto.org.\nQuarto is available under the MIT license.\nSometimes when we say “Quarto” we mean “a Quarto document”, i.e., a plain-text Quarto markdown file with the extension .qmd. And sometimes when we say “Quarto” we mean the Quarto Command Line Interface (CLI), which can render .qmd files as well as .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook), .Rmd (R Markdown), and .md (Markdown) files.",

The value of title in the document header usually becomes the level-1 heading of the document, which is why sections usually start with level-2 headings.\nYou can attach attributes to headings by adding curly braces {} after the heading text. For example, you might add an identifier to a section heading to enable cross-referencing:\n## Section Title {#sec-section-title}\nOr you might add a class like .unlisted to exclude a section from the table of contents:\n## Section Title {#sec-section-title .unlisted}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 3.1: What are attributes?\n\n\n\nAttributes are a way to add metadata to markdown elements, usually inside curly braces {} after the element. Attributes are used extensively in Quarto to control the behavior or appearance of many elements.\nThe types of thing you can add as attributes include:\n\nIdentifiers (IDs), should be unique and start with #\nClasses start with .\nKey-value pairs use key='value' syntax.\n\nThe order of attributes matters: identifiers must come first, followed by classes, and then key-value pairs.",

Here are the essential rules you need to know.\n\n5.2.1 Key-value pairs\nOptions are written as key-value pairs separated by a colon and a space:\ntitle: My Document\nThe space after the colon is required—title:My Document won’t work.\n\n\n5.2.2 Indentation matters\nYAML uses indentation to show structure. When options are nested, indent them consistently:\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\nUse spaces for indentation, not tabs. Two spaces per level is the convention, but the exact number doesn’t matter as long as you’re consistent.\n\n\n5.2.3 Arrays\nSome options accept multiple values. There are two ways to write arrays in YAML.\nBracket syntax puts all values on one line, separated by commas:\ntheme: [cosmo, custom.scss]\nDash syntax puts each value on its own line, prefixed with a dash:\ntheme:\n  - cosmo\n  - custom.scss\nBoth are equivalent—use whichever you find more readable.\n\n\n5.2.4 When you need quotes\nMost values don’t need quotes, but you’ll need them when your value contains special characters like : or #:\ntitle: \"My Report: 2024 Edition\"\nsubtitle: \"#QuartoTips\"\nYou’ll also need quotes if your value looks like a number or boolean but should be treated as text:\nversion: \"2.0\"\ncode: \"true\"\nWithout quotes, 2.0 would be interpreted as a number and true as a boolean.",

This single output file is the only thing that needs to be transferred to the provider to share it with others. However, for some formats, notably HTML, Quarto generates a collection of files, which might depend on other local files like images. All of these files and their dependencies need to be transferred to the provider to publish the content successfully.

You could copy and paste that example, save it as a .qmd and it would be ready to render.\nTo include this kind of snippet in your own Quarto documents, use quadruple backticks to surround the snippet, and double any curly braces on executable code cells. As an illustration, the above example was created with:\n````\n---\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: false\n---\n\n## Some code\n\n```{{r}}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n````\nThe same quadruple backtick approach works in many other venues that use Markdown like GitHub Issues, GitHub Discussions and the Posit Community Forum.

More specifically, this chapter focuses on what you put in the parts of your document that are interpreted as markdown—that is, everything that isn’t the document header, or an executable code cell.\nOur goal is to give you a good overview of breadth of Quarto’s authoring features, while delaying many of the details to later chapters of the book. We also focus on syntax that is broadly supported across multiple output formats and cover specific format features where relevant in ?sec-output-formats.\nWe suggest reading through the chapter in its entirety on your first reading, and then referring back to specific sections as needed when authoring your own documents.\nEverything that isn’t the document header or an executable code cell is interpreted as Quarto markdown. Quarto markdown inherits much of Pandoc’s markdown syntax, but uses its own parser. This means you can use familiar markdown syntax, though there are some differences from Pandoc. The rest of this chapter outlines the most useful Quarto markdown syntax.\nWhile we distinguish between executable code cells and markdown in the source document, this distinction disappears after rendering. When cells execute, their output becomes markdown and is treated identically to other markdown content. Executable code cells produce block-level markdown, so you can only use them where block elements are allowed. For example, as list items, inside fenced divs, or inside table cells. You cannot use code cells inline with text or inside section headings.",

The value of title in the document header usually becomes the level-1 heading of the document, which is why sections usually start with level-2 headings.\nYou can attach attributes to headings by adding curly braces {} after the heading text. For example, you might add an identifier to a section heading to enable cross-referencing:\n## Section Title {#sec-section-title}\nOr you might add a class like .unlisted to exclude a section from the table of contents:\n## Section Title {#sec-section-title .unlisted}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 10.1: What are attributes?\n\n\n\nAttributes are a way to add metadata to markdown elements, usually inside curly braces {} after the element. Attributes are used extensively in Quarto to control the behavior or appearance of many elements.\nThe types of thing you can add as attributes include:\n\nIdentifiers (IDs), should be unique and start with #\nClasses start with .\nKey-value pairs use key='value' syntax.\n\nThe order of attributes matters: identifiers must come first, followed by classes, and then key-value pairs.",

    "text": "10.7 Tables\nThe simplest way to add a table to a Quarto document is to create a markdown pipe table, however cells in a markdown pipe table cannot contain block content like multiple paragraphs, code cells, or lists. To have cells with complicated cell contents, you can use an alternative syntax called list tables. You can also use HTML table syntax, regardless of your target format, to create tables in Quarto documents. You won’t usually write HTML syntax by hand, but it is a common output from computational packages that create tables.\nTables are so important in Quarto documents that we dedicate an entire part of this book to them. For more details, see ?sec-figtab.\n\n10.7.1 Markdown pipe tables\nThe simplest syntax for a table in Quarto markdown is known as the pipe table, named because columns are separated by the pipe (|) character. A pipe table consists of column headers, a separator row of dashes (-) and pipes (|), and data rows with pipe-separated cells.\nFigure 10.3 gives an example of a pipe table, along with its rendered output. The line after the table, starting with :, is optional, and specifies the caption and any attributes for the table (inside curly braces {}). For example, the table is given the ID #tbl-perf so it is numbered and can be cross-referenced.\n\n\n\n\n| Algorithm           | Accuracy | Time  |\n|---------------------|----------|-------|\n| Random Forest       | 96.7%    | 0.12s |\n| Logistic Regression | 81.2%    | 0.08s |\n| Linear Regression   | 74.8%    | 0.05s |\n\n: Training performance {#tbl-perf}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Markdown syntax and rendered output for a markdown pipe table\n\n\n\n\n\n10.7.2 List tables\nTODO: Revisit this once the list-tables extension is bundled with Quarto. Specifically, where does the caption go.\nList tables use markdown list syntax to create tables where cells can contain multiple paragraphs, code cells, or lists. List tables need to be wrapped in a fenced div with the class list-table. Inside the div, each row is represented as list item, with each cell as an subitem.\nFor example, to create the same table content as Figure 10.3 using a list table, you would include the following in your document:\n::: {#tbl-perf .list-table}\nTraining performance \n\n* - Algorithm\n  - Accuracy\n  - Time\n* - Random Forest\n  - 96.7%\n  - 0.12s\n* - Logistic Regression\n  - 81.2%\n  - 0.08s\n* - Linear Regression\n  - 74.8%\n  - 0.05s\n:::\nTo include more complicated content in cells, like code blocks or formulas, include them as you would in normal markdown, but maintain indentation for the list structure, and the required white space for the content type:\n::: {.list-table}\n* - Code\n  - Model for the mean\n* - \n    \n    ```r\n    summary(lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data = mtcars))\n    ```\n\n  - \n    $$\n    \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{wt} + \\beta_2 \\text{cyl}\n    $$\n:::\n\n\n10.7.3 HTML tables\nYou can also use HTML to create tables in Quarto documents, regardless of your target format. You typically won’t write HTML tables by hand—instead, you’ll generate them with code cells or import them from other tools.\nAs an example, to generate the same table as Figure 10.3 with HTML, you could include the following in your document:\n```{=html}\n&lt;table id=\"tbl-perf\"&gt;\n  &lt;caption&gt;Training performance&lt;/caption&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Algorithm&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Accuracy&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Random Forest&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;96.7%&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;0.12s&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Logistic Regression&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;81.2%&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;0.08s&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;Linear Regression&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;74.8%&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;0.05s&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n```\n\n\n10.7.4 From a code cell\nWhen the output from an executable code cell is a markdown or HTML table, it will be included in your Quarto document.\nTo add an identifier and caption to the table use the code cell options label and tbl-cap respectively:\n```{LANGUAGE}\n#| label: tbl-example\n#| tbl-cap: \"Caption\"\n\n# Code that generates a markdown or HTML table\n```",

    "text": "10.13 Fenced divs\nFenced divs are a component that Quarto uses extensively to create block-level regions of content with specific behaviors or styles. For example:\n\ncallout blocks (Section 10.14) are specified as a fenced divs with a special class attribute,\na two column panel layout (Section 10.15) is specified using a fenced div with a key-value attribute, and\nyou can make an element cross-referenceable with an identifier attribute that starts with a special prefix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhat’s a div?\n\n\n\nThe term div originates from the &lt;div&gt; tag in HTML, where it is used to define a division or region in a document. The term fenced div comes from Pandoc markdown, and describes the specific markdown syntax used to create a div with a fence of colons (:::).\nFenced divs provide a way to create &lt;div&gt; elements when rendering to HTML. But, more importantly, fenced divs are easily intercepted by Quarto. The result is that many Quarto features use the fenced div syntax to define a region of content that needs special handling. Quarto recognizes these divs, processes them, and inserts suitable markup depending on the target format.\n\n\nA fenced div begins with at least three consecutive colons followed by possibly empty curly braces with attributes. The div ends with another line of at least three consecutive colons. The div should be separated by blank lines from the blocks before and after it. For example, here’s a fenced div with no attributes:\n::: {}\nThis content is inside a div with no attributes\n:::\nThe attributes may include an identifier (starting with #), one or more classes (starting with .), and key-value pairs (key='value'):\n::: {#id .class1 .class2 key='value'}\nThis content is inside a div with an identifier, two classes, and a key-value attribute\n:::\nYou can also nest fenced divs inside one another:\n::::: {#id .class1 .class2 key='value'}\n\n::: {}\nContent inside the nested div\n:::\n\nMore content inside the top-level div\n:::::\nThe number of colons used to open and close a fenced div do not need to match, but it can be useful to match them for readability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipA single class shorthand\n\n\n\nWhen the only attribute of a fenced div is a single class, it can be written using a shorthand syntax that omits the curly braces, and the . on the class name:\n::: class-name\nContents of the div.\n:::",

    "text": "10.15 Layout\nFenced divs (Section 10.13) are also used to lay out content on the page. There are two common ways to control layout:\n\nPanel layouts arrange content in rows and columns using layout-* attributes, useful when you want elements to be side by side, or arranged in a grid.\nColumn classes arrange content across different widths of the page, useful when you need to give content more horizontal space, or put elements in the margin.\n\n\n10.15.1 Panel layouts\nUse a fenced div with the layout-ncol key-value attribute to arrange content in multiple columns. It’s best to be explicit about what each item is by nesting them each in their own fenced div.\nFor example, to place two items side by side in two columns, set layout-ncol=\"2\" and nest each item in its own fenced div, as shown in Figure 10.9.\n\n\n\n::::: {layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {}\nContent for the first column.\n:::\n\n::: {}\nContent for the second column\n:::\n:::::\n\n\n\n\nContent for the first column.\n\n\nContent for the second column\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.9: Two-column layout syntax and rendered output\n\n\n\nThe content inside each item can be any block content, including paragraphs, lists, code cells, images, or tables. Further items will fill into new rows and Quarto will allocate vertical space as needed. In HTML formats, the layout is responsive so that on smaller screens the items will stack vertically.\nUse the layout-nrow attribute if you’d prefer to specify the grid by the number of rows, or for more complicated layouts use the layout attribute. You can see more examples using figures and tables as content in ?sec-figtab-layout.\n\n\n10.15.2 Column classes\nFor format: html and format: pdf, the page is divided into a body content area and a right margin. By default, your content will be placed in the body area. You can override this by putting content in a fenced div and adding special column classes.\nFor example, to place content in the right margin use the .column-margin class:\n\n\n\n::: {.column-margin}\nThis content will appear in the right margin.\n:::\n\n\nThis content will appear in the right margin.\n\n\nFigure 10.10: Column margin syntax and rendered output\n\n\n\nUse the .column-page-right class to expand content into the margin to give it more horizontal space:\n\n\n\n::: {.column-page-right}\nThis content will expand into the right margin.\n:::\n\nThis content will expand into the right margin.\n\n\n\nFigure 10.11: Column page right syntax and rendered output\n\n\n\nAdditional classes are available to provide more horizontal whitespace, and for format: html columns that expand to the left, and to the full screen width. See the Quarto documentation for the full list of classes.\nYou can also see more examples with figures and tables, including computational outputs in ?sec-figtab-layout.",

    "text": "11.1 What is a Quarto Project?\nSo far, we’ve concentrated on single Quarto documents: a single .qmd which defines all of its Quarto options in its header. In this chapter, you’ll learn about Quarto projects: a way to organize collections of Quarto documents. You’ll learn:\nFrom a technical perspective, a Quarto project is simply a folder that contains the file _quarto.yml. From a practical perspective, using a Quarto project has two benefits:\nFigure 11.1 shows the folder ds-project, a simple example of a data science project, that contains some Quarto documents.\nTo turn this folder into a Quarto project, add the file _quarto.yml, as shown in Figure 11.2.\nThe presence of _quarto.yml, even if empty, signals to Quarto this is a project, and allows you to render without specifying a file:\nQuarto will then render all Quarto documents in the project. In this example, the files, 01-import.html and 02-visualize.html, and their supporting folders, 01-import_files/ and 02-visualize_files/ are created (Figure 11.3).\nYou’ll learn more about previewing and rendering projects in Section 11.3.\nBeyond indicating that the folder is a Quarto project, the file _quarto.yml also stores Quarto YAML options. These can be project-level options or document-level options common to the documents in the project. Project-level options are set under project, one of which is type. If the file _quarto.yml is empty, or if type is unspecified, the type is assumed to be default. That is, it’s equivalent to:\nOther project types include manuscript, website, and book, which you’ll learn more about in ?sec-manuscripts, Chapter 17 and ?sec-books.\nYou’ll learn about a few more project-level options in Section 11.4.1 and about setting common document options in Section 11.4.2.",

    "section": "11.4 Project Configuration — _quarto.yml",
    "text": "11.4 Project Configuration — _quarto.yml\nThe file _quarto.yml provides project configuration. Typically it will include project-level options, project options specific to the project type, and document-level options common to documents in the project.\nHere’s a typical example:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\n1project:\n  type: website\n  title: \"Quarterly Reports\"\n\n2website:\n  navbar:\n    search: true\n\n3execute:\n  echo: false\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n\n\n1\n\nProject level options are set under project. You’ll learn more about these in Section 11.4.1.\n\n2\n\nProject type specific options are set under the option that matches the type, e.g. website. You learn about these in the later chapters on the different project types.\n\n3\n\nDocument-level defaults that apply to all documents in the project. You’ll learn more about these below in Section 11.4.2.\n\n\nIf you are curious what a more complicated _quarto.yml might look like, you could look at the _quarto.yml file on GitHub for the project that builds this book.\n\n11.4.1 Project Level Options\nProject level options are set under the project key. You’ve already seen projects might have a type and title.\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  type: default\n  title: Data Exploration \n\nAnother commonly set option is output-dir which specifes a location for rendered output.\nWithout setting output-dir outputs are rendered alongside their source documents. For example, as you saw in Figure 11.3, the output 01-import.html is rendered in the same location as 01-import.qmd.\nIt might be easier to have your outputs written to their own directory. You could set output-dir to reports:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  output-dir: reports\n\nNow when the project is rendered the output files end up in reports/ folder, as shown in Figure 11.4.\n\n\n\n\n\ntemp-dirs/ds-project2\n├── 01-import.qmd\n├── 02-visualize.qmd\n├── README.md\n├── _quarto.yml\n├── data\n│   └── records.csv\n└── reports\n    ├── 01-import.html\n    ├── 01-import_files\n    ├── 02-visualize.html\n    └── 02-visualize_files\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4: The contents of ds-project/ after rendering when output-dir is set to reports.\n\n\n\nThe heirachical structure of the project is maintained in the output directory. So, if there was another document provenance.qmd inside the data/ folder, it would render to reports/data/provenance.html.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipOther types of project have a default output directory\n\n\n\nYou usually don’t need to set output-dir for other project types because they have a default. For example, websites render to a _site/ folder, and books to a _book/ folder.\n\n\nYou can see other available project options on the Project Options reference page in the Quarto documentation.\nSome project types also set project-level options under a key that matches their type. For instance, when a project is a website, site level settings are set under the website key:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  navbar:\n    search: true\n\n\n\n11.4.2 Common Metadata\nDocument options, like those you normally set in a YAML header, can also be set in _quarto.yml. Options set in _quarto.yml will be applied to all Quarto files in the project, and reduce repetition by specifying common options in a single location.\nAs an example, consider a project with two Quarto documents, 01-import.qmd and 02-visualize.qmd, where truncated versions are shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n01-import.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: Data Import and Cleaning\nauthor: Soraya Drake\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    code-fold: true\n---\n\n## Import\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n02-visualization.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: Exploratory Visualization\nauthor: Soraya Drake\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    code-fold: true\n---\n\n## Distributions\n\n...\n\n\n\n\nThese two documents share common settings in the document YAML: author, and the html format options toc and code-fold. If these options are moved to the file _quarto.yml, they will be applied to every Quarto document in the project. So, if _quarto.yml is:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nproject: default\n\nauthor: Soraya Drake\n\nformat: \n  html:\n    toc: true\n    code-fold: true\n\nThen the two documents can have simplified YAML headers that now only need to specify the title:\n\n\n\n\n\n01-import.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: Data Import and Cleaning\n---\n\n## Import\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n02-visualization.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: Exploratory Visualization\n---\n\n## Distributions\n\n...\n\n\n\n\nAs an added advantage, if you add more Quarto documents, you don’t need to remember the exact settings you used, and can just let your new document inherit them from _quarto.yml.\nIf a document specifies a different option to _quarto.yml, it will override the default value. For instance, if there is another document 03-modelling.qmd with a different author, specifying author in the document YAML will override the value set in _quarto.yml:\n\n\n03-modelling.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: Modelling\nauthor: Aurelius Garcia\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipDirectory level metadata\n\n\n\nIf you would like to specify common metadata for documents inside a sub-directory our your project, you can do so by adding a file called _metadata.yml to the sub-directory. Read more in the Quarto Documentation at Directory Metadata.\n\n\nUsing _quarto.yml can help reduce duplication in the metadata of your documents, but once you have related documents in a project, you often also find you have duplicated content. You can reduce duplication of content by using the include shortcode described in Section 10.18. #### Multiple Formats\nYou can set defaults for more than one format in _quarto.yml by nesting them under format:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nformat:  \n  pdf: \n    toc: true\n    toc-title: \"Contents\"\n  html: \n    toc: true\n    toc-title: \"On this page\"\n\nIf an option applies to all formats you can list it at the top-level. For example, you could pull out toc: true to the top-level:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\ntoc: true\n\nformat:  \n  pdf: \n    toc-title: Contents\n  html: \n    toc-title: On this page\n\nIf a file doesn’t specify a format, all formats described in _quarto.yml will be rendered when the project is rendered. However, if a document specifies any formats only those will be rendered. For example, you could specify a document should only be rendered to html:\n\n\nreport.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: \"Report\"\nformat: html\n---\n\nIf you need to override options for one format, but still want the other formats rendered, you’ll need to specify all formats. Use default as the value for any formats with no options overridden. For example, you might set the table of contents depth for the html format, but use all the default settings for pdf:\n\n\nreport.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: \"Report\"\nformat: \n  html:\n    toc-depth: 3\n  pdf: default\n---\n\nYou can use the same idea to add additional formats for a single document that aren’t specified at all in _quarto.yml:\n\n\nreport.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: \"Report\"\nformat: \n  html: default\n  pdf: default\n  docx: default\n---",

    "text": "11.6 Version control\nSince .qmd files are plain text, they are ideal for storing in a version control system like Git. A common approach is to have a Git repository for each Quarto project, and to commit all source files (.qmd, _quarto.yml, images, etc.). Sharing your source then becomes as easy as hosting the repository on something like GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket.\nWe’ll point out certain files or folders you may, or may not, want to commit as we introduce them. However, we list a few items common to most projects in the sections below.\n\n11.6.1 .gitignore\nIf Quarto detects your project is under Git version control it may add items to .gitignore directly. In particular, the folder .quarto/ will generally be added. This folder is used for temporary artifacts of the Quarto rendering process and never needs to be committed. You should generally commit any changes Quarto makes to .gitignore.\n\n\n11.6.2 Output files and directories\nIn general, you don’t need to commit rendered document files or the output directory (e.g. _site/ for websites, _book/ for books, _manuscript for manuscripts, or the value of output-dir) because they can always be recreated by rendering them. However, there are some circumstances it makes sense to commit them:\n\nYou are producing stand-alone files and the hosted repo is the venue for sharing them. Including stand-alone files (e.g. PDF or Word documents) in a repo can make for a large repository, and diffs on them aren’t usually very useful, but it can make sense if you need to be able to grab easily, or link to, old versions of documents.\nYou are directly hosting web content from your repository, for example via the docs/ folder on GitHub, or with Git-backed hosting from Netlify.",

    "text": "12.2 General YAML syntax\nIn this section you’ll learn the necessary YAML fundamentals to avoid syntax errors when setting options. Although the syntax applies generally to any YAML, all the examples you’ll see are valid Quarto options and values.\n\n12.2.1 YAML Mappings\nA YAML mapping is the specification of a key-value pair using the syntax key: value. Values can be simple, like a string, boolean, or number:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\n1title: My Document\n2toc: true\n3toc-depth: 2\n---\n\n\n1\n\nA string\n\n2\n\nA boolean, true/false\n\n3\n\nA number\n\n\nOr, values can be more complicated like another mapping. When the value of a key is another mapping, indentation is used to keep track of scope. For example, here the value of the author key is another mapping, setting name to the value Soraya Drake:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: My document\nauthor:\n  name: Soraya Drake\n---\n\nIt doesn’t matter how many spaces you indent as long as you use spaces (as opposed to tabs), and use the same number consistently. A common style convention, and the one we follow in this book and in Quarto documentation, is to use two spaces for each level of indentation. For example, the name key nested under author is indented two spaces, whereas the name key nested under affiliation, which itself is nested under author, is indented four spaces:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: My document\nauthor:\n  name: Soraya Drake\n  affiliation: \n    name: Everpine University    \n    url: http://everpine.edu\n---\n\nThe names you can use in Quarto, along with the types of values they take, are not specified by the YAML language, but by Quarto’s own schema.\n\n\n12.2.2 YAML Sequences\nA YAML sequence is a way to provide a key a set of ordered values. There are two syntaxes to specify a YAML sequence. When the values in the sequence are simple, separate them with commas inside square brackets:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\ntheme: [cosmo, styles.scss]\n---\n\nThe alternate syntax puts each value on its own line, and adds a dash prefix followed by a space:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\ntheme: \n  - cosmo\n  - styles.scss\n---\n\nThis alternate syntax can also handle situations where the values are further mappings. For example, here the value of author is a sequence of length two, where each element is a mapping of name and affiliation:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: My document\nauthor:\n  - name: Soraya Drake\n    affiliation: Everpine University    \n  - name: Zahir Kamarov\n    affiliation: Peregrine Heights Institute\n---\n\n\n\n12.2.3 YAML Scalars\nYAML uses the term scalar to talk about the simplest types of value: strings, numbers, and booleans. You saw an example of each earlier:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: My Document  # A string\ntoc: true           # A boolean, `true`/`false`\ntoc-depth: 2        # A number\n---\n\nThe only values recognized as boolean are true and false; numbers can be single integers (2), decimals (2.1), or scientific (2.1e+2), and anything else is treated as a string.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipYAML comments\n\n\n\nThe hash symbol (#) indicates the start of a comment, which is ended by the end of the line.\n\n\n\n\n12.2.4 Quotes\nStrings don’t require quotes, but you may need them if your string contains characters that have special meaning in YAML (e.g. #, :, etc.), or is something that would otherwise be interpreted as a number or boolean:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: \"Quotes: and things that need them\"  \nauthor: \"#quarto\"\nsubtitle: \"100\"\n---\n\nIn YAML, double-quoted strings (\") allow escape characters in them, whereas single-quoted strings (') are interpreted literally:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: \"Quotes: \\U0001F4E8\"\nsubtitle: 'Quotes: \\U0001F4E8'\n---\n\nQ: where does the \\U go in subtitle go? YAML might be interpreting literally but Quarto/Pandoc might escape somewhere?\n\n\n12.2.5 Long strings\nFor strings that are longer than you’d comfortably put on a single line, or need explicit line breaks, you can use what YAML calls block scalars .\nThere are two styles: literal and folded.\nLiteral block scalars are indicated by a pipe (|), and line breaks are considered significant, whereas folded block scalars are indicated by a greater than symbol (&gt;), and line breaks are collapsed to spaces.\nIn both cases, start your string on a new line indented under the key:\n\n\n\n\n\nliteral.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: |\n  A title\n\n  spanning two lines\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nfolded.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: &gt;\n  A title\n\n  collapsed into one line\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Rendered title using literal (|) block scalar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Rendered title using folded (&gt;) block scalar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1\n\n\n\nDepending on where the string value is used, line breaks may or may not mean anything to Quarto. For instance, when interpreted as markdown, a single line break doesn’t result in anything in the output. However, a double line break will be interpreted as a new paragraph.\n\n\n12.2.6 Using default\nYou’ll come across examples where the value of a Quarto option is default, like when you are specifying multiple formats:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\nformat:\n  html: default\n  pdf: default\n---\n\nThe value default doesn’t have a special YAML meaning— it’s something Quarto adds for certain options where the value is usually another mapping, but you just want the default values for all properties.",

    "section": "12.3 What happens when you get it wrong?",
    "text": "12.3 What happens when you get it wrong?\nWhen you render a project or document, one of the first things that happens is the options are parsed and validated. When you make a mistake in setting an option there are a few possible outcomes:\n\nYou get an error message, and the error message clearly points out your mistake.\nYou get an error message, but it’s not clear from that message what or where your mistake is.\nYou don’t get an error message at all.\n\nIt’s hard to enumerate all the ways you can make a mistake, but we’ll give a couple of examples for each of these outcomes in the hope it helps you track down yours.\nSome examples in this chapter will result in an error from quarto render—we’ve highlighted these examples with a red border (TODO: add an icon for PDF version), like this:\n\n\nrender_error.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: Bad YAML : (\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe error messages shown in the text are current as of Quarto 1.6.\n\n\n\nWe’ve split the examples by the kind of mistake you make:\n\nUsing the wrong YAML syntax\nUsing the wrong name for an option\nUsing the wrong type of value for an option\n\n\n12.3.1 Using the wrong YAML syntax\nWhen your YAML can’t be parsed by Quarto you’ll get a YAMLException error. These are actually surprisingly rare, not because everyone is great at YAML, but because most YAML syntax mistakes don’t result in invalid YAML. The YAML remains valid, it just won’t be interpreted in the way you intended.\nFor example, if you forget the space after a colon when setting an option like code-fold:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: \"Untitled\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    code-fold:true\n---\n\nThen you don’t get a YAMLException but instead a validation error:\nValidation of YAML front matter failed.\n(line 5, columns 5--18) Field \"html\" has value code-fold:true, which must instead be an object\n\n✖ The value code-fold:true is a string.\nℹ The error happened in location format:html.\nℹ In YAML, key-value pairs in objects must be separated by a space.\nℹ Did you mean code-fold: true instead?\nThe YAML has been parsed, but with the missing space code-fold:true was interpreted as a string not a mapping. Quarto does a good job here suggesting what your mistake might have been and a solution.\nGenerally, if you get a validation error, first check your syntax carefully.\n\n\n12.3.2 Specifying the wrong key\nThere are some instances where when you use the wrong name for an option you’ll get an error. For example, if you pluralize the lightbox option loop:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\ntitle: \"Presentation\"\nformat: html\nlightbox: \n  loops: true \n\nYou’ll get a YAML validation error that catches and reports the problem:\nERROR: Validation of YAML front matter failed.\nERROR: In file long-string.qmd\n(line 5, columns 3--8) property name loops is invalid\n4: lightbox: \n5:   loops: true \n    ~~~~~~\nℹ The error happened in location lightbox:loops.\nℹ Did you mean loop?\nOptions where Quarto only allows a certain set of property names are known as closed schemas, e.g., the lightbox option has a closed schema. However, not all Quarto options have closed schemas.\nWhen the schema is open, Quarto simply accepts an unknown option name and you get no error. For example, you might use an underscore instead of a hyphen in code-fold:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: My document\nformat: \n  html:\n    code_fold: true\n---\n\nEven though code_fold isn’t a recognized option for html, you’ll get no error. But, you also won’t get any code folding. Why does Quarto have open schemas? There are lots of places it makes sense to let users define their own keys, for example, when you want to use the meta shortcode and define some custom keys in your metadata.\nA similar problem occurs when you nest options incorrectly. For example, you might get code-fold right, but forget to nest html under format:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: My document\nhtml:\n  code-fold: true\n---\n\nAs a top-level option html isn’t something Quarto knows about, but it passes validation. The result is no error, and no folded code.\nCode completion can be a useful indicator for these problems. If you aren’t getting the completion you expect, perhaps you’ve got the wrong name, or you’ve nested it under the wrong option.\n\n\n12.3.3 Specifying the wrong type of value\nChecking the type of value you’ve passed is something Quarto is good at, assuming your syntax is correct and you’ve got the right option name.\nFor example, consider trying to add a table of contents like this:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: My document\ntoc: yes\n---\n\nUpon render, Quarto returns the error:\nERROR: Validation of YAML front matter failed.\nERROR: (line 3, columns 6--8) Field \"toc\" has value yes, which must instead be `true` or `false`\n\n✖ The value yes is a string.\nℹ The error happened in location toc.\nℹ Quarto uses YAML 1.2, which interprets booleans strictly.\nℹ Try using true instead.\n\nERROR: Render failed due to invalid YAML\nThis is a really useful message—it tells you the YAML front matter validation failed; it tells you where the problem is, (line 3, columns 6--8) Field \"toc\"; and it tells you what the problem was, Quarto expected a boolean, but got a string. It even suggests a solution try using true instead.\nNot all validation error messages are as illuminating. For example, consider trying to add an “Other Link” like this:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: \"Untitled\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    other-links: http://quarto.org\n---\n\nThe validation error returned is:\nERROR: Validation of YAML front matter failed.\nERROR: In file type-errors.qmd\n(line 5, columns 18--34) Field \"other-links\" has value http://quarto.org, which must instead be 'false'\n4:   html:\n5:     other-links: http://quarto.org\n                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n6: ---\nIt’s clear where the error is ((line 5, columns 18--34) Field \"other-links\"), and that the wrong type of value has been encountered. But it’s unclear what Quarto actually wants. It says it was expecting false, but that doesn’t help us figure out how to actually specify a link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipObtuse messages\n\n\n\nQuarto tries not to overwhelm you with output in an error message, but sometimes the process of shortening an error message leads to a message that isn’t very helpful.\nThis particular form of message that ends with which must instead be x, is a common culprit of being too brief to be helpful. Quarto will often report one value, x, often the first alphabetically, but in reality there are many values that the option could take.\n\n\nFor validation errors like this you should look for an example in the Guide section of Quarto. In the section “Code and Other Links” you can see an example showing Quarto was expecting an array of objects:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: \"Untitled\"\nformat:\n  html:\n    other-links: \n      - text: Quarto\n        href: http://quarto.org\n---\n\n\n\n12.3.4 Ways Quarto tries to help\nQuarto ships with YAML intelligence which encompasses two tools you can use to help you get your YAML right: YAML completion and YAML validation.\nThese tools are available in RStudio, and the Quarto extension for VS Code and Positron. The code to implement them comes with the Quarto CLI, which means they’ll always represent your current version of Quarto.\n\n12.3.4.1 YAML completion\nYAML completion suggests code completions when you are editing YAML in your Quarto documents and projects. You can hit a shortcut to see suggested completions of option names, and values.\nUse completion:\n\nAt the top-level without typing anything to remind yourself of available options.\nWhen you have started typing an option name to avoid mis-spelling it. If the option doesn’t appear as a completion, check you have it nested correctly.\nAfter completing the option name to get suggested values. This is particularly useful for options that take one of a few special strings.\n\n\n\n12.3.4.2 YAML validation\nYAML validation performs the same validation that occurs when you render, but provides feedback and help where and when you are editing. It is activated when you save your file.\nIt will warn you when:\n\na value has the incorrect type\na value isn’t one of the enumerated allowable values\nthe name of an option isn’t valid (but only in situations where free-form options aren’t allowed)\nindention is inconsistent",

These pages are automatically generated from the YAML schema defined in the source code of the Quarto CLI.\nThe options available depend on where the option will be applied. From smallest to largest scope these are: to a code cell, to a document format, or to a project.\nThose scopes also map to where you put the option: inside the code cell, in the document header, or in _quarto.yml. However, you can generally apply options to a larger scope, by placing them in the corresponding location. For example, echo is a code cell option, but you can use it in the document header to apply to formats, or you can use it in _quarto.yml to apply to all documents in a project.\nTable 12.1 matches the sections of the Reference Guide, to the other names for the same options, and where the options might be found. In the following sections, you’ll work through these scopes from largest to smallest and learn some general principles to help you put your options in the right place.\n\n\n\nTable 12.1: The three kinds of options you can set in Quarto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference Guide Section\nOther names\nWhere they might occur\n\n\n\n\nProjects\nProject options\nProject metadata\n_quarto.yml\n\n\nFormats\nDocument options\nDocument metadata\nDocument header\n_quarto.yml\n\n\nCode Cells\nExecution options\nCode cells, i.e. after #|\nDocument header\n_quarto.yml",

For example, options under the website key set up global navigation, and website level metadata.\nProject options aren’t the only thing you might find in _quarto.yml.

    "section": "12.6 Document options",
    "text": "12.6 Document options\nDocument options can be tricky because they can appear in lots of different ways. For example, the toc option might appear:\n\nat the top-level of a document header:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: My document\nformat: html\ntoc: true\n---\n\nnested under a format in the document header:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: My document\nformat: \n  html:\n    toc: true\n---\n\nor in _quarto.yml:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\ntoc: true\n\n\nTo understand what these variations mean, and when to use them, you’ll dive into the following principles:\n\nEverything is a format option\nTop-level options are applied to all formats\nOptions in _quarto.yml apply to all documents\n\n\n12.6.1 Everything is a format option\nConsider the following document header:\n---\ntitle: My document\ntoc: true\nformat: html\n---\nFrom Quarto’s perspective, this is equivalent to the header:\n---\nformat:\n  html:\n    title: My document\n    toc: true\n---\nThat is, the options title and toc are HTML format options. It’s convenient to be able to put things at the top-level, but internally, Quarto will move those options under each format. This is why Quarto’s reference pages are laid out by format—options are supported, or not, depending on the output format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteOK, not quite everything…\n\n\n\nengine is an option that isn’t applied at a format level—you cannot specify different engines for different formats.\n\n\n\n\n12.6.2 Top-level options are applied to all formats\nQuarto assumes any options you specify at the top-level should be applied to all formats. For example, if we extend our document header to add the pdf format:\n---\ntitle: My document\ntoc: true\nformat: \n  html: default\n  pdf: default\n---\nQuarto interprets this as:\nformat:\n  html:\n    title: My document\n    toc: true\n  pdf: \n    title: My document\n    toc: true\nThis is a good example of why this behavior exists—you’ll want many options to be the same across formats, and being able to specify them at the top-level saves a lot of typing.\nOption values nested under a format will override any specified at the top level. For example, you might want toc: true for most formats, but override it for revealjs:\n---\ntitle: My document\ntoc: true\nformat: \n  html: default\n  pdf: default\n  revealjs:\n    toc: false\n---\nThere are a couple of consequences of this behavior to be aware of:\n\nOptions are silently ignored by formats that don’t support them. While this is true regardless of where you set the option, it can be harder to remember when you set options at the top-level. For example, you can set cold-fold: true at the top-level, and it will work great for format: html, but it isn’t supported by format: pdf.\nYAML completion will suggest options at the top-level that are supported by at least one format, but that might not be the format you targeting. For example, the completion fig-pos is suggested at the top-level, but it only applies to format: pdf.\n\nBoth are reminders that understanding whether an option is supported by a format is up to you, and the best way to check is on the Quarto reference pages for the formats you are targeting.\n\n\n12.6.3 Options in _quarto.yml apply to all documents\nYou can move any options you’ve set in the document header to _quarto.yml and they’ll apply to all documents in your project.\nFor example, if you want all documents in the project to have a table of contents you could include toc: true in your _quarto.yml file:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\ntoc: true\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteengine is the exception again\n\n\n\nYou can’t set engine at the project level by putting it in _quarto.yml.\n\n\nOptions specified in _quarto.yml follow the same principles as those in the document header. By specifying toc: true at the top-level it will apply to all formats. Alternatively, you could specify it for a specific format, e.g. pdf, by nesting it under the format:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nformat: \n  pdf:\n    toc: true\n\nAs discussed in Section 11.4.2 you can override any options in _quarto.yml at a document-level by setting them in the document header. However, if you specify any formats via format in a document header, only those specified will be rendered, regardless of which formats are specified in _quarto.yml. This gets a little tricky, so let’s look at a couple of examples. Consider Snippet 12.1: a _quarto.yml that sets one top-level option, toc, for all formats, an html option code-fold, and specifies default options for the pdf format.\n\n\n\nSnippet 12.1: An example of project level options\n\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\ntoc: true\nformat: \n  html:\n    code-fold: true\n  pdf: default\n\n\n\n\nFor any document in the project, that would be equivalent to setting the following in the document header:\n---\nformat:\n  html:\n    toc: true\n    code-fold: true\n  pdf:\n    toc: true\n---\nThe result of quarto render would be an HTML document (with a table of contents and using code fold), and a PDF document (with a table of contents).\nWhen a document sets a format via format either with no options (Snippet 12.2 (a)) or as the result of setting an option nested under the format (Snippet 12.2 (b)), only the options for that format are merged from _quarto.yml (Snippet 12.3 (a) and Snippet 12.3 (b) respectively). The result of quarto render on Snippet 12.2 (a) and Snippet 12.2 (b) is only an HTML document.\n\n\n\nSnippet 12.2: A document that sets a format in the document header\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) format: html set with no other options.\n\n\n---\nformat: html\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) format: html set with additional options.\n\n\n---\nformat: \n  html:\n    toc: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnippet 12.3: The equivalent header for the files in Snippet 12.2 when merged with the settings in _quarto.yml.\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n---\nformat: \n  html:\n    toc: true\n    code-fold: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n---\nformat: \n  html:\n    toc: false\n    code-fold: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to specify some format specific options in a document, but maintain the full list of target formats from _quarto.yml, specify all formats in the document header. For example, to override some HTML options, but use the PDF options from _quarto.yml, add pdf: default to the list of formats:\n---\nformat: \n  html:\n    toc: false\n  pdf: default\n---\n\n\n12.6.4 _metadata.yml\nThere is one additional place you can put document options: in a _metadata.yml file. Options placed in _metadata.yml will apply to all documents in the same directory as the _metadata.yml.\nOnly for document options (and execution options if they have a document equivalent), not project options.\n\n\n12.6.5 Command line metadata\nCommand line metadata overrides metadata set in files:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto render document.qmd -M toc:false",

    "section": "12.7 Execution options",
    "text": "12.7 Execution options\nWe use the term execution options to describe options you can set in code cells. The set of options available depends on your execution engine: knitr, jupyter or ojs.\nYou can generally split execution options into two types:\n\ninformation that is unique to a code cell like identifiers (label, lst-label), captions (fig-cap, tbl-cap, lst-cap, fig-subcap, tbl-subcap, fig-scap) or other annotation (fig-alt, fig-link).\nsettings that could conceivably apply to many code cells that control things like: if the code is executed (eval), or how code and results appear in the output(echo, output, warning, error), where output appears (column, panel, output-location), or how code is presented (code-fold, code-overflow, code-line-numbers).\n\nFor options in the later category, just like document options, you can increase their scope by moving them: to the document header to apply to all code cells in the document; or to _quarto.yml to apply to all code cells in the project.\n\n12.7.1 Execution options set in code cells\nExecution options are set in code cells using YAML syntax after a special comment:\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\n```\nExecution options need to be specified before any code, and are prefaced by the native comment character for the code cell language (# for r, python and julia), followed by a pipe (|), and a space.\nYou can use the same YAML syntax as in the document header, but for multiline statements, remember to preface each line with the cell option comment. For example, to use a literal block string:\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: |\n#|   Here's a long caption\n#|   spread over two lines\n\nplot(1:10)\n```\n\n\n12.7.2 Execution options set in the document header\nAs reasonable working model, assume you can move an execution option from a code cell to the document header and it will apply to all code cells in the document. For example, you could move echo: false out of a code cell and into the document header:\n\n\ndocument.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: My document\necho: false\n---\n\nYou can override the document level setting by setting the option in a code cell:\n```{r}\n#| echo: true\n\n```\nWhen you move an option in this way it behaves just like a document option:\n\nTo figure out if an option is supported at the document level look in the reference guide for your target formats.\nIf you nest an execution option under a format, it will only apply to that format.\n\nSo, while assuming you can move an execution option to the document header is a good working model, the definitive way to check is to see if it is a document option for your target formats.\nThere are a couple of special cases it is worth pointing out.\n\n\n12.7.3 fig-width and fig-height\nFor the jupyter engine, fig-width and fig-height are document options only—you cannot set them at the cell level. If you need cell level control of the size of a figure, you’ll need to set it in the code that creates the figure.\n\n\n12.7.4 Knitr specific options\nThere are a number of execution options that are specific to the knitr engine, that don’t have document option equivalents. Some common ones include message, collapse and prompt.\nYou can set these for all code cells using the knitr: chunk_opts option. For example, to suppress all messages:\n---\ntitle: \"Untitled\"\nformat: html\nknitr:\n  opts_chunk:\n    message: false\n---\n\n\n12.7.5 Execution options set in _quarto.yml\nWhen an execution option is also a document option, you can move it to _quarto.yml to apply to all code cells in a project.\nFor example, to omit the code “echo” all code cells, and all formats, in a project you could set echo at the top-level of _quarto.yml:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\necho: false\n\nYou can then override this at the document or cell level as usual.",

    "text": "13.2 An HTML document with R code cells\nThe document in Snippet 13.1, html-r.qmd, is a Quarto document that targets the HTML format and contains two R code cells.\n\n\n\nSnippet 13.1: html-r.qmd is a Quarto document with R code cells and placeholder text, targeting HTML output.\n\n\n---\ntitle: My document\nformat: html\n---\n\n## Some computation\n\n```{r}\n#| code-line-numbers: true\n1 + 1\n```  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nplot(1:10)\n```\n\n\n\nThe process this file undergoes when you call quarto render is illustrated in Figure 13.1. You’ll dive into the details of each step below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: The quarto render process for html-r.qmd\n\n\n\n\n13.2.1 Before the computational engine\nBefore anything else, Quarto parses your file to extract the document header and code cells. Quarto determines the set of formats that need to be rendered and select the appropriate computational engine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipInclude shortcodes are also resolved\n\n\n\nInclude shortcodes are also resolved at this stage because they may contribute code cells to the document.\n\n\nIt’s at this stage you’ll get errors about malformed YAML in your document header— these start with ERROR: YAMLError:. You can learn more about common YAML issues in Chapter 12.\nEach input file is only ever run through one computational engine: knitr, jupyter, or julia. 1 With no additional information from the metadata (e.g. none of engine, jupyter, nor knitr), Quarto will choose the engine based on the file extension and the language of executable code cells in the document.\nFor .qmd documents, Quarto will use:\n\nknitr, if there are any {r} code cells.\njupyter, if there are any executable code cells other than {r}. The Jupyter kernel will be chosen based on the first executable code cell.\nThe markdown engine, equivalent to using no computational engine, if there are no executable cells.\n\nFor html-r.qmd, HTML is the only format specified in the header, and assuming no --to argument was specified in the quarto render call, Quarto will know to target it. Since, html-r.qmd contains executable R code cells (and doesn’t specify engine otherwise) Quarto selects the knitr engine.\n\n\n13.2.2 Computational engine\nThe selected computational engine is informed of the target format. It runs the executable code cells and any inline code expressions, replacing them with appropriate Markdown, abiding by the execution options specified in the metadata and code cells. The result is a Markdown file. You can examine this Markdown file by adding keep-md to your document metadata:\n---\ntitle: My document\nkeep-md: true\n---\nSnippet 13.2 shows the resulting Markdown file for html-r.qmd. Notice that the document header and Markdown content have passed through unchanged. However, there are now no {r} code cells. These are replaced by Markdown, albeit with some special classes attached.\n\n\n\nSnippet 13.2: html-r.html.md the intermediate Markdown created after passing html-r.qmd through the knitr engine.\n\n\n---\ntitle: My document\nformat: html\n---\n\n## Some computation\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-line-numbers=\"true\"}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](html-r_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFor example, the executable code cell that does some addition in Snippet 13.2 (a) is replaced in Snippet 13.2 (b) by a fenced div with the class .cell that contains:\n\nA non-executable code cell {.r} with class .cell-code and the attribute code-line-numbers=\"true\" that contains the code — this is the “echo”.\nA fenced div with classes .cell-output and .cell-output-stdout that contains a code cell with the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The original code cell.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| code-line-numbers: true\n\n1 + 1\n``` \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The code cell after being processed by the knitr engine.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-line-numbers=\"true\"}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.2: A code cell in html-r.qmd before and after being processed by the knitr computational engine.\n\n\n\nYou can see a similar transformation has occurred on the code cell creating a plot. However, now there is no “echo”, because the code cell included the option echo: false, and the output is an image stored in html-r_files/figure-html/.\nThe name of the intermediate file, html-r.html.md, includes the format, .html because the engine is run separately for each format. The Markdown output and supporting files are format specific. You’ll see an example of this in Section 13.4.\nIf you receive an error from the computational engine, you won’t get the get the intermediate Markdown file. Common errors that arise during execution by the computational engine are discussed in Section 13.7.2.\n\n\n13.2.3 Pandoc\nThe Markdown file is passed along to Pandoc2 for conversion into the desired output format. Pandoc’s role in rendering provides many of the features for authoring Quarto documents. For example, the syntax you learned for headings, quotations, lists, tables, links and footnotes is the syntax defined by Pandoc (see Pandoc’s Markdown on the Pandoc documentation site). Other more complicated features, like the default handling of citations with citeproc, also come directly from Pandoc (see Citations on the Pandoc documentation site).\nHowever, Quarto adds many of its own features beyond those available in Pandoc. These are added via an established mechanism for customizing Pandoc output: filters. When Pandoc reads an input file, it translates it into an abstract representation known as an abstract syntax tree. Filters are functions that operate on this abstract syntax tree, transforming it before it is written out to the desired format. Cross-references, shortcodes3, and code annotation are examples of features that Quarto adds via filters.\nFor documents targeting the HTML format the output file returned to you is the output returned from Pandoc. An excerpt from html-r.html, the HTML file returned from quarto render html-r.qmd is shown in Snippet 13.3. There are more than 100 lines of HTML prior to this excerpt, but we’ve excluded that code here to focus on the part of the document that reflects our content.\n\n\n\nSnippet 13.3: An excerpt from html-r.html—the final output file from rendering html-r.qmd\n\n\n&lt;section id=\"some-computation\" class=\"level2\"&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=\"anchored\" data-anchor-id=\"some-computation\"&gt;Some computation&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"cell\"&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"sourceCode cell-code\" id=\"cb1\"&gt;&lt;pre class=\"sourceCode numberSource r number-lines code-with-copy\"&gt;&lt;code class=\"sourceCode r\"&gt;&lt;span id=\"cb1-1\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"#cb1-1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=\"dv\"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"sc\"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"dv\"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;button title=\"Copy to Clipboard\" class=\"code-copy-button\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"bi\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"cell-output cell-output-stdout\"&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1] 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"cell\"&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"cell-output-display\"&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;figure class=\"figure\"&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"html-r_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png\" class=\"img-fluid figure-img\" width=\"672\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\n\n\n\nThe Markdown is now converted to HTML. For example, the Markdown section heading ## A computation is represented by a &lt;h2&gt; heading:\n&lt;h2 class=\"anchored\" data-anchor-id=\"some-computation\"&gt;Some computation&lt;/h2&gt;\nThe fenced divs have been literally converted to &lt;div&gt; elements, and code blocks to &lt;pre&gt; elements.\nThis HTML file requires some additional resources for a browser to correctly render it, but Quarto provides them all in html-r_files/. When you open html-r.qmd in a browser you’ll see the final rendered document (Figure 13.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.3: The HTML document that is produced with quarto render html-r.qmd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTemplates contribute document boilerplate\n\n\n\nConverting the Markdown to HTML commands isn’t enough to have a complete HTML document. The converted content is pasted into a template that adds the boilerplate required to form a complete document. Quarto has default templates it uses unless otherwise specified. You’ll learn more about templates and customizing them in ?sec-templates.\n\n\n\n\n13.2.4 Monitoring the process on the command line\nYou can also see this process in the messages Quarto prints as it runs. These messages are generated when you run quarto render or quarto preview, but you may have missed them because they scroll quickly past or are hidden in a pane in your IDE. In Figure 13.4, you can see the messages Quarto prints in the Terminal during a successful render of html-r.qmd.\nKnitr generates the first chunk of output as it processes the document and runs the code in the three (unnamed) chunks. The remaining output gives some information on the settings being passed along to pandoc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminal\n\n1$ quarto render html-r.qmd\n\n2processing file: html-r.qmd\n1/5\n2/5 [unnamed-chunk-1]\n3/5\n4/5 [unnamed-chunk-2]\n5/5\noutput file: html-r.knit.md\n\n3pandoc\n  to: html\n  output-file: html-r.html\n  standalone: true\n  section-divs: true\n  html-math-method: mathjax\n  wrap: none\n  default-image-extension: png\n\nmetadata\n  document-css: false\n  link-citations: true\n  date-format: long\n  lang: en\n  title: My document\n                                \n4Output created: html-r.html\n\n\n1\n\nQuarto starts working, you may hang here for awhile as Quarto parses what it needs to plan its work.\n\n2\n\nKnitr executes the code cells\n\n3\n\nThe information passed along to Pandoc\n\n4\n\nA final message from Quarto indicating success\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.4: The output printed by quarto render when run on html-r.qmd.",

Unlike html-r.qmd, html-python.qmd contains only Python code cells, so Quarto will select the jupyter engine. Since the first code cell is a Python code cell, the python kernel will be selected.\n\n\n13.3.2 Computational engine\nNow rather than knitr, the jupyter engine is responsible for executing the code cells and replacing them with Markdown.\nThe intermediate file html-python.md.html is shown in Snippet 13.5. Just like when knitr processed html-r.qmd, the jupyter engine has replaced the executable code cells ({python}) with non-executable ones ({.python}), and placed the code and output in fenced divs with appropriate classes.\n\n\n\nSnippet 13.5: html-python.html.md, the intermediate Markdown created after passing html-python.qmd through the jupyter engine.\n\n\n---\ntitle: My document\nformat: html\n---\n\n## Some computation\n\n::: {#05056103 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-line-numbers=\"true\"}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=2}\n```\n2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#13ea8596 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nplt.plot(range(1, 11)) \nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](html-python_files/figure-html/cell-4-output-1.png){width=566 height=411}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFunctionally, the different engines should produce very similar output given the same code, but they do have their own idiosyncrasies. For instance, you can see the jupyter engine has added unique code cell identifiers and an execution_count attribute to the code cells.\n\n\n13.3.3 Pandoc\nNothing changes in the Pandoc step. The intermediate Markdown is passed to Pandoc with the exact same settings as in the html-r.qmd example.\n\n\n13.3.4 Monitoring the process on the command line\nYou can also see the similarities in the process through messages Quarto prints on the command line (Figure 13.6). The only difference is where the computational engine runs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminal\n\n1$ quarto render html-python.qmd\n\n2Starting python3 kernel...Done\n\nExecuting 'html-python.quarto_ipynb'\n  Cell 1/3: ''...Done\n  Cell 2/3: ''...Done\n  Cell 3/3: ''...Done\n    \n3pandoc\n  to: html\n  output-file: html-python.html\n  standalone: true\n  section-divs: true\n  html-math-method: mathjax\n  wrap: none\n  default-image-extension: png\n  toc: true\n\nmetadata\n  document-css: false\n  link-citations: true\n  date-format: long\n  lang: en\n  title: My document\n  \n4Output created: html-python.html\n\n\n1\n\nQuarto starts working\n\n2\n\nJupyter executes the code cells\n\n3\n\nThe information passed along to Pandoc\n\n4\n\nA final message from Quarto indicating success\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.6: The output printed by quarto render when run on html-python.qmd.",

This means the the engine can tailor output to the target format. In Snippet 13.7 you can see the intermediate Markdown file that is produced.\n\n\n\nSnippet 13.7: pdf-r.pdf.md the intermediate Markdown file after the knitr engine has exectuted the code in pdf-r.qmd\n\n\n---\ntitle: My document\nformat: pdf\n---\n\n## Some computation\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-line-numbers=\"true\"}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](pdf-r_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIt is mostly identical to that produced when the target format was HTML, but there are some differences.

When the target format is PDF, Pandoc only converts to LaTeX, and Quarto handles the remaining conversion from LaTeX to PDF.\nThis means Pandoc is called on pdf-r.pdf.md in the same way as on pdf-r.html.md, but with the format set to latex. You can examine the .tex file Pandoc returns by setting keep-tex to true:\n---\ntitle: My document\nformat: pdf\nkeep-tex: true\n---\nAn excerpt of the resulting .tex file is shown in Snippet 13.8. Above this excerpt is almost 200 lines of other TeX commands setting up the document.\n\n\n\nSnippet 13.8: An excerpt from pdf-r.tex, the TeX file created after passing pdf-r.pdf.md through Pandoc.\n\n\n\\subsection{Some computation}\\label{some-computation}\n\n\\begin{Shaded}\n\\begin{Highlighting}[numbers=left,,]\n\\DecValTok{1} \\SpecialCharTok{+} \\DecValTok{1}\n\\end{Highlighting}\n\\end{Shaded}\n\n\\begin{verbatim}\n[1] 2\n\\end{verbatim}\n\n\\includegraphics{pdf-r_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf}\n\n\n\nNow the Markdown syntax has been converted to TeX syntax: section headings are created with the TeX command \\subsection, code cells use Shaded and Highlighting environments, and output uses appropriate commands like the verbatim environment for code output, and the \\includegraphics command for the image file.\n\n\n13.4.4 After Pandoc\nThere is an additional step now required—Quarto runs the .tex document through LaTeX to produce the PDF.\nQuarto will look for, and use an installation of TeX. If TeX is not installed, you can install it with:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto install tinytex\n\nQuarto will prefer the version installed this way over other installations.\nQuarto will use the detected installation and process the .tex file as many times as needed to resolve all cross references and citations.\nFigure 13.9 shows part of the PDF output that results for pdf-r.qmd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.9: A portion of the final PDF document produced by pdf-r.qmd",

Before the computational engine, Quarto recognizes that more than one format is a target.

    "text": "13.6 Other variations\n\n13.6.1 Other types of input file\nYou’ve seen the render process specifically for .qmd inputs, but Quarto accepts other types of input files. For .Rmd, .ipynb, and .md, the primary difference is that the engine is selected based on the file type: jupyter for .ipynb , but see Note 13.1; knitr for .Rmd ; and markdown for.md.\nFor script files (.R,.py,.jl etc.) the file is pre-processed into a .qmd file before continuing the render process as described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 13.1: Python notebooks aren’t normally executed\n\n\n\nSince .ipynb files store their output alongside the source, the code cells are not executed by default when you run quarto render. To execute the cells, pass the --execute flag to quarto render:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto render document.ipynb --execute\n\n\n\n\n\n13.6.2 Other target formats\nMost formats are like HTML, they are simply passed along to Pandoc with the Markdown file, Pandoc handles the conversion to the target format, and Quarto does no further processing.\nOne exception is Typst. Typst is like PDF: Pandoc handles the conversion into the Typst format .typ, and Quarto handles the final conversion to PDF. In contrast to format: pdf where Quarto looks for an external TeX installation, for format: typst Quarto runs the Typst version provided internally with Quarto. This is equivalent to:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto typst compile document.typ\n\n\n\n13.6.3 Preview vs. render\nWhen you are working with a Quarto document, you’ll often be running quarto preview as opposed to quarto render. Think about quarto preview as a two-step process: first, run quarto render; then, serve the document. For HTML documents this means starting up a webserver, for other formats, opening some other form of viewer.\n\n\n13.6.4 Rendering projects\nThink about rendering a project, as rendering a folder of documents, where each one goes through the process above. Quarto often needs to do some processing before, or after (or both) rendering each document, depending on the type of project. For example, for websites Quarto needs to run through all documents to build the list of navigation items, before rendering individual pages.\nSome projects may also involve freeze. When freezing a document it is the intermediate Markdown file that gets put in the freezer, effectively removing the computational engine step when the freezer is activated.",

    "text": "13.7 Troubleshooting\nIn this section, you’ll learn some tips for troubleshooting problems when they do occur.\n\n13.7.1 Run quarto check\nAs you’ve seen, Quarto potentially accesses and runs many other tools. The quarto check command is a good way to check the versions of these tools and the exact ones Quarto is finding.\nRun quarto check on the command line in your project after activating the relevant environment (if any):\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto check\n\nFigure 13.11 shows example output from quarto check with the following highlighted:\n\nQuarto version: Check your Quarto version against the latest release, particularly when documented features don’t seem to work for you. Before reporting a bug, you should confirm that your problem exists on the latest release, and it is good practice to also confirm that it exists on the latest pre-release version.\nInternal dependencies: Tools listed here are bundled with Quarto, and you cannot link Quarto to newer versions of those tools yourself. However, knowing these versions can be useful for troubleshooting. For instance, you might be trying to use a feature of Typst that is newer than the version bundled with Quarto.\nQuarto installation: The version here will match the one reported on the first line, but adds the path to Quarto. If you manage multiple installations of Quarto, you should check that you are getting the one you expect here.\nTools installed by Quarto: These tools aren’t included with Quarto but they can be installed with quarto install. TinyTex is recommended for producing PDFs via format: pdf; and Chromium is required for producing versions of Mermaid and Grapviz diagrams suitable for use in PDF or DOCX. You can also check these tools by running quarto tools which will inform you if they are out of date. You can update them with quarto update.\nLaTeX: Information about the TeX distribution Quarto will use.

If you see some indication Knitr is running when you expected Jupyter, override the automatic choice by explicitly setting the engine with the engine key:\n---\nengine: jupyter\n---\nIf you want the julia engine, Quarto will never automatically select it; you must opt-in via the engine key.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAvoiding execution\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of choosing an engine, a code cell with the option eval: false is still considered an executable code cell, even though the code inside will not be executed. This means you might see an engine starting even if you’ve set eval: false at the document level. To avoid even starting an engine, and executing any code, you can explicitly use the markdown engine:\n---\nengine: markdown\n---\n\n\n\n\n13.7.2.2 Wrong Environment\nThe usual symptom of Quarto not using the right environment is the failure to load packages you are sure you installed. Troubleshooting your environment is language-specific, and you should refer back to the relevant sections of Chapter 7, Chapter 8, and ?sec-julia.\n\n\n13.7.2.3 Code Errors\nWhen the code in your executable code cells generates an error, the computational engine will halt and Quarto will exit. Figure 13.12 shows an example of this for the three engines–—in all cases the code cell producing the error requests the variable x which hasn’t been defined. The output differs by engine, but you’ll generally see the engine start progressing through the cells (e.g. Cell 1/1 in Figure 13.12 (a)) then an error report native to the language of your cells (e.g. NameError: name 'x' is not defined from Python in Figure 13.12 (a)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecuting 'python-error.quarto_ipynb'\n  Cell 1/1: ''...ERROR: \n\nAn error occurred while executing the following cell:\n------------------\nx\n------------------\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nNameError             Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[2], line 1\n----&gt; 1 x\n\nNameError: name 'x' is not defined\n\n\n(a) A computational error when using the jupyter engine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprocessing file: r-error.qmd\n1/2                  \n2/2 [unnamed-chunk-1]\n\n\n\nQuitting from lines 7-8 [unnamed-chunk-1] (r-error.qmd)\nError:\n! object 'x' not found\nExecution halted\n\n\n(b) A computational error when using the knitr engine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning [1/1] at line 7:  x\nERROR: Julia server returned error after receiving \"run\" command:\nFailed to run notebook: /Users/charlottewickham/Documents/posit/weekly-log/2024-09-30/julia-error.qmd\nERROR: EvaluationError: Encountered 1 error during evaluation\n\nError 1 of 1\n@ /Users/charlottewickham/Documents/posit/weekly-log/2024-09-30/julia-error.qmd:7\nUndefVarError: `x` not defined\n\n\n(c) A computational error when using the julia engine\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.12: Example output from quarto render when there is an execution error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipKeeping an error in your output\n\n\n\nIf you want to show an error in your document, set the option error: true in the corresponding code cell. This will prevent the error from halting execution, and include the error message in your rendered document.\n\n\nYou are now in the realm of debugging your R, Python, or Julia code. The first way to make your life easier is to label your code cells:\n```{r}\n#| label: get-x\nx\n```\nWhen the engines process your code cells, they will include the label, helping you to identify which code cell caused the error quickly.\nIf the error isn’t obvious, run your code from top to bottom interactively in a clean session of your interpreter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipRun all\n\n\n\nIn RStudio, use the command Restart R Session and Run All Chunks.\nIn the Quarto extension for VS Code and Positron, use the command Quarto: Run All Cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.7.3 Things that aren’t errors\nSome problems don’t rise to the level of errors. You might get output from quarto render but it might not look right. In this case, a general troubleshooting process might look like:\n\nVerify you’re working with the current release of Quarto (e.g. with quarto check).\nFind an example of what you are trying to do in the documentation and verify it works. If it does work, gradually alter it to match your example, until it no longer works—you’ll either discover what you are doing wrong, or you’ll produce a minimal reproducible example.\nAsk for help using your reproducible example.\n\n\n\n13.7.4 Asking for help\nIf you can’t figure out the problem yourself, your next step is to ask someone. A good question includes:\n\nA description of your problem, including what you expected to happen and what actually happened.\nA minimal reproducible example (see Section 6.4).\nThe output from quarto check.\n\nSome good venues to ask questions are the discussion board on the quarto-cli repository and Posit community.",

    "text": "17.2 Minimal website\nA website is just a collection of HTML pages, usually sharing some common elements like navigation or theming. In Quarto, a website project is a collection of Quarto documents targeting the HTML format, along with some website configuration in _quarto.yml.\nThe simplest Quarto project that results in a website consists of a directory with two files:\n\nindex.qmd (or .md or .ipynb) that renders to index.html—the homepage. For illustration, we’ll use a simple file with a title and some placeholder text:\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: Home\n---\n\n{{&lt; lipsum 1 &gt;}}\n\nA _quarto.yml file that contains:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n\n\nThe specification of type: website in _quarto.yml means when you render the project, Quarto identifies it as a website, renders all the Quarto documents in the project, inserts the relevant website scaffolding and puts the resulting files in a _site/ directory.\nThe resulting _site/ directory is a completely self-contained description of the website.\nFigure 17.1 shows the contents of the _site/ directory for a minimal website. It contains the rendered .html files, in this case only index.html, along with other required resources. The folders in _site/site_libs contain scripts and other source files for some of Quarto’s website tools and can be shared by all pages in the website.\n\n\n\n_site/\n├── index.html\n├── search.json\n└── site_libs\n    ├── bootstrap\n    ├── clipboard\n    ├── quarto-html\n    ├── quarto-nav\n    └── quarto-search\n\n\nFigure 17.1: The contents of _site/ for a minimal Quarto website\n\n\n\nTo view your website, you need a webserver to serve up the contents of this directory. This could be a local webserver like the one used for quarto preview, or a remote one like those provided by Quarto Pub or GitHub Pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipStart with a template\n\n\n\nYou can turn any folder into a Quarto website by adding _quarto.yml, but if you are starting from scratch you can make use of the quarto create command.

For instance, when you add items to navigation, you may need to stop the current preview, and restart another preview to see the changes you’ve made.\n\nIt’s also important to use quarto preview (either via the Render/Preview button in your IDE or on the command line) rather than opening a generated .html file directly in your browser. A file opened directly in your browser will use the file:// protocol, rather than the http:// protocol, and some features of Quarto websites may not work, i.e. search.",

    "section": "17.4 Website Structure",
    "text": "17.4 Website Structure\nIn this section, you will learn how your project structure translates to your website structure. You’ll start by understanding how the location of your files in your project translates to the location of your pages in your site. Then you’ll learn how to link to other pages and use anchors to link to sections, figures, and other elements. Finally, you’ll see a couple of options for excluding documents from your site or to redirect to them from different URL paths.\n\n17.4.1 File structure translates to URL structure\nThe structure of your files in your project directly translates to their structure in site/, and consequently, to where your pages will be available on your website.\nConsider the website project in Figure 17.2. The project root is my-website/: the top-level directory, defined by the presence of _quarto.yml. To the right of each file, you’ll see the URL at which the file will be available.\n\n\n\nmy-website/  \n├── _quarto.yml\n├── index.qmd             { base }\n├── about.qmd             { base }/about.html         \n├── reports/                       \n|    ├── index.qmd        { base }/reports            \n|    └── last-month.qmd   { base }/reports/last-month.html                        \n└── data/                         \n    └── sales.csv         { base }/data/sales.csv   \n\n\nFigure 17.2: File paths from your project root directly translate to URL paths from your base URL.\n\n\n\nWe use the placeholder { base } to represent the base URL of your website. When you are previewing locally that will be something like http://localhost:3884, where the number 3884 may be something else. When you publish your website, the base URL will depend on where you host it. For GitHub Pages it might look something like https://username.github.io/repository-name, and on Quarto Pub something like https://username.quarto.pub/project-name, or you might even have a custom domain https://yourdomain.com.\nConsider the file about.qmd at the top level of your website project. It will be available at about.html at the top level of your website. If you place last-month.qmd inside a reports/ folder in your website project, it will available at reports/last-month.html on your website.\nIndex files are special — the index.qmd in any directory becomes the landing page for that directory. So, for example reports/index.qmd defines the page seen by someone navigating to { base }/reports or { base }/reports/.\nFiles don’t have to be Quarto documents. The CSV file data/sales.csv will be available at { base }/data/sales.csv. However, only rendered Quarto documents or files that Quarto deems to be necessary are copied into _site/. This means the presence of data/sales.csv isn’t enough for it to be included in the website. It either needs to be referenced in a way Quarto will detect, e.g., linked to from another page (see Section 17.4.2), or be included in the site resources (see Section 17.4.6).\nLater in this section you’ll learn two ways to disrupt this direct correspondence between project paths and URL paths. You’ll see how to:\n\nExclude or ignore project files, so they aren’t part of the website.\nProvide alias URLs, so that visitors are redirected from a URL to a document at a different path.\n\n\n\n17.4.2 Links\nA key feature of webpages is the interlinking of pages. Table 17.1 summarizes what you’ll learn in this section—how to make in-text links. You’ll learn how to add navigation links, another key kind of link, in Section 17.5.\n\n\n\nTable 17.1: In-text link syntax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nSyntax\nResult\n\n\n\n\nRelative link to another page\n[About](about.qmd)\nA link to about.qmd in the same directory\n\n\nAbsolute link to another page\n[About](/about.qmd)\nA link to about.qmd in the project root\n\n\nLink to a section on this page\n[Data](#data)\nA link to the anchor #data on the current page\n\n\nLink to a section on another page\n[Contact Me](/about.qmd#contact)\nA link to the anchor #contact on the about.qmd page in the project root\n\n\nExternal link\n[Quarto](http://quarto.org)\nA link to the website http://quarto.org\n\n\nLink with attributes\n[Quarto](http://quarto.org){.external target=\"_blank\"}\nA link to the website quarto.org with the class .external that opens in a new window or tab.\n\n\nCross-References (only within pages)\n@fig-dist\nA link to the figure, along with a preview on hover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.4.2.1 Linking to pages\nYou create a link using the usual markdown syntax, but you can refer to other Quarto documents in your website project. For example, from index.qmd you might link to the page about.qmd:\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\n[About](about.qmd)\n\nThis is an example of a relative link—it uses the path relevant to the document in which it is located. In this case, the result is a link to about.html located at the same level in _site/ as index.html.\nNotice that the link used the extension .qmd. Quarto handles the translation so that the link in the rendered index.html will point correctly at about.html. One advantage of using .qmd is that Quarto will complain if it can’t find the document at the path you specified.\nIn addition to relative links you can use absolute links. Absolute links start with slash (/) and are relative to the project root. It’s particularly important to use absolute links in content that may be reused via an include shortcode at various levels in your site.\n\n\n17.4.2.2 Linking to sections or IDs\nYou can link to a specific location within a page using the fragment identifier, a hash (#) followed by an identifier. In Quarto, all section headers are given identifiers automatically which makes it easy to link directly to a section.\nAs example, you could link to the “Data” section using the link #data:\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\n## Introduction\n\nSee [Data](#data)\n\n## Data\n\nQuarto will generate an identifier by converting to lower case and replacing spaces with dashes (-), then adding a numeral it the anchor would otherwise be non-unique. Rather than remember the rules, it can be easier to specify your own. Place your identifier prefaced by # in curly braces after the section title:\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\n## Introduction {#intro}\n\nSee [Data](#data)\n\n## Data\n\nBack in the [introduction](#intro)\n\nYou can link to identifiers on other pages, too, by adding them to the document path. For instance, to link to the Introduction section in index.qmd from about.qmd:\n\n\nabout.qmd\n\nRead more in our [Introduction](index.qmd#intro)\n\nThere are a lot of elements beyond sections that get identifiers automatically in Quarto. You can find the identifier of an element by looking for an id in the element in the rendered HTML (usually using something like your web browser development tools). Or, you can provide your own. For example, for any element created with a fenced div, add an identifier to the curly braces:\n:::{#my-callout .callout-tip}\n\nHere's a callout I can link to with `#my-callout`.\n\n:::\nOr for elements that are created inline add a anchor in the curly braces following the element. For example, to an image:\n![Caption](image.png){#my-figure}\nYou might recognize that this is very similar to adding a cross-reference, except we didn’t start the identifier with one of the recognized cross-reference prefixes.\n\n\n17.4.2.3 External Links\nTo link to external websites, use the full URL, including the .html extension and fragment if applicable:\n[Quarto website links](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/#linking)\nYou can add the class .external to give a visual indication that a link will leave your site:\n[Quarto website links](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/#linking){.external}\nYou can additionally supply other attributes to include in the link in the curly braces. For example you might add target=\"_blank\" to open the link in a new tab or window:\n[Quarto website links](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/#linking){.external target=\"_blank\"}\nYou can learn more about external links in the Quarto documentation.\n\n\n\n17.4.3 Cross-references\nCross-references will work within pages in a Quarto website, but will not work across pages. That is, you cannot reference with the @ syntax an element defined in a different document.\nTo link to a cross-reference on another page, you could use a link:\nRecall from the [histogram of the data](explore.qmd#fig-dist)...\nIf you must have across page cross-references, consider using a book project instead, see ?sec-books.\n\n\n17.4.4 Aliases\nAliases are alternative URLs that point to the same page. Typically, you use aliases when you move content so that is it still available from an old URL.\nFor example, if you move a page from /blog/first-post.qmd to /blog/first-post/index.qmd, you can set up an alias so visitors using the old URL are automatically redirected to the new location:\n\n\n/blog/first-post/index.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: My Post\naliases:\n  - /blog/first-post.html\n---\n\n\n\n17.4.5 Excluding content from your website\nThe easiest way to exclude a file from your website is to name it with an underscore, or place it in a folder that starts with an _. For instance, if you are keeping a list of to do in todo.md you don’t want them rendered as part of your website, you could put them in a _notes/ folder:\nmy-website/  \n├── _notes\n|   └── todo.md\n└── index.qmd\nAn alternative approach is to use the project option render which specifies the files that should be rendered. The render option takes a sequence of files you do want to render:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n  render: \n    - index.qmd\n\nTo exclude files, start by specifying everything you want to render, then ignore the ones you want to exclude using the !:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n  render: \n    - \"*.qmd\"\n    - \"!ignore-dir/\"\n    - \"!ignore-doc.qmd\"\n\n\n\n17.4.6 Including content in your website\nWhen you reference a file in your content (like including an image or linking to a document), Quarto will copy the file to _site/.\nBut, if Quarto fails to detect your file, or you want to include a file you don’t reference can explicitly include files using the resources project option. For example, you could include all Excel (.xlsx):\nproject:\n  type: website\n  resources: \n    - \"*.xlsx\"",

    "text": "17.5 Navigation\nThe primary navigation in a Quarto website is provided by a top or side navigation bar. Figure 17.3 gives an example of each with a single navigation link to the page generated by the file about.qmd. Both top and side navigation include the website title, “My website”, which links to index.html, then a link to about.html, where the text for the link comes from the metadata of the about.qmd page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.3: Rendered navigation with a single navigation item linking to the page about.qmd.\n\n\n\nTop and side navigation bars are configured in _quarto.yml. Figure 17.4 gives the configuration for the two examples in Figure 17.3:\n\nTop navigation is specified under navbar, with navigation items listed under left (or right).\nSide navigation is specified under sidebar, with navigation items listed under contents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nwebsite:\n  title: My website\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - about.qmd\n\nTop navigation\n\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nwebsite:\n  title: My website\n  sidebar:\n    contents:\n      - about.qmd\n\nSide navigation\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.4: Configuration for navigation with a single navigation item linking to the page about.qmd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipNavigation collapses on small screens\n\n\n\nBoth the top navigation bar and side navigation bar collapse into a dropdown menu on small screens. If you are previewing your website in a small window (e.g. the Viewer in RStudio or Positron), you might need to expand the window to see the navigation as displayed in Figure 17.3.\n\n\nTop and side navigation share many features, you can:\n\ncontrol the title displayed in the navbar with title,\ninclude a logo, along with setting alternative text (logo-alt) and a link (logo-href), in the navigation,\ninclude icon-only navigation items under tools, and\ninclude a site search box.\n\nOne of primary differences between top and side navigation is how deeply you can nest navigational items. Top navigation limits you to one-level of nesting via drop down menus. With side navigation you can nest deeply using sections to create a hierarchy of navigation items.\nTop navigation is a good choice when you have a small set of links, each with succinct link text. When you expect users to take a linear path through your site consider side navigation. Side navigation also has the advantage of more easily handling longer link text, and a deeper hierarchy of content.\nMore complicated sites might benefit from what is known as hybrid navigation (Section 17.5.4), a combination of top and sidebar navigation, where the links in the top navigation direct users to sections of the site which each have their own side navigation.\nIn the rest of this section, you’ll learn how to specify navigation items more flexibly and then see some more comprehensive examples of top and side navigation. The section ends with a quick survey of navigation elements you can add beyond primary navigation.\n\n17.5.1 Navigation items\nNavigation items can simply be a path to another document in the website project (e.g. about.qmd), or you can provide a navigation item object.\nA navigation object must at least contain the property href, which may be a path to a file in your website project (relative to your project root), or a URL to an external site. The other most common properties are text, the text used for the link, and icon the name of a Bootstrap Icon to add to the link:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nwebsite:\n  title: My website\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: about.qmd\n        text: About Us\n        icon: file-person\n\nThe full set of navigation item properties are shown in Table 17.2.\n\n\n\nTable 17.2: Properties of navigation items. Source: Quarto documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nhref\nLink to file contained with the project or external URL.\n\n\ntext\nText to display for navigation item (defaults to the document title if not provided).\n\n\nicon\nName of one of the standard Bootstrap 5 icons (e.g., github, house, share, etc.).\n\n\naria-label\nAccessible label for the navigation item.\n\n\nrel\nValue for rel attribute. Multiple space-separated values are permitted.\n\n\ntarget\nValue for target attribute. E.g., _blank to open in a new tab.\n\n\nmenu\nList of navigation items to populate a drop-down menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.5.2 Top Navigation\nFigure 17.5 illustrates a top navigation bar that includes a logo, title, search box, and navigation links arranged on the left, right and as tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.5: The components of a top navigation bar (navbar)\n\n\n\nThe configuration to create this navigation is shown in Snippet 17.1.\n\n\n\nSnippet 17.1: The configuration for the navigation bar in Figure 17.5\n\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nwebsite:\n  title: Drake Lab              \n  navbar:\n    logo: d-lab.svg\n    logo-alt: Drake Lab logo\n    left: \n      - blog.qmd\n    right:\n      - projects.qmd\n      - people.qmd\n    tools:\n      - href: https://github.com\n        icon: github\n\n\n\n\nThis example demonstrates the options to navbar that control the contents of the navigation bar. These options are described further in Table 17.3.\n\n\n\nTable 17.3: Content options for navbar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nleft/right\nArrays of navigation items (Section 17.5.1) that are arranged in the bar on the left and right respectively.\n\n\ntools\nAn array of navigation items displayed only using their icons, positioned to the right of the right links.\n\n\ntitle\nIf title is unspecified under navbar, which it is in Snippet 17.1, it will inherit from the title field under website. You can specify title explicitly under navbar if you want different title text, or set title: false under navbar to omit it (e.g. you might if your logo contains the same text).\n\n\nlogo\nAn image (.svg, .png, .jpg etc.) to include on the left of the navigation bar. Set logo-alt to specify the alternative text for the logo. Set logo-href if you want the logo to link to somewhere other than index.html.\n\n\nsearch\nBy default a search box will be shown in the navigation bar. You can omit the search box by setting search: false. To control the search options, use the search option at the website level, see Website Search in the Quarto Documentation for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are additional options to navbar that control its behavior, the are described in Table 17.4. There are also background and foreground options to control the colors in the navigation bar, but unless these are the only color customizations you’ll do, we recommend using the methods outlined in Section 17.6 instead.\n\n\n\nTable 17.4: Behavior options for navbar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\npinned\nAlways show the navbar (true or false). Defaults to false, and uses headroom.js to automatically show the navbar when the user scrolls up on the page.\n\n\ncollapse\nCollapse the navbar items into a hamburger menu when the display gets narrow (defaults to true).\n\n\ncollapse-below\nResponsive breakpoint at which to collapse navbar items to a hamburger menu (sm, md, lg, xl, or xxl, defaults to lg).\n\n\ntoggle-position\nThe position of the collapsed navbar hamburger menu when in responsive mode (left or right, defaults to left).\n\n\ntools-collapse\nCollapse tools into the navbar menu when the display becomes narrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.5.2.1 Nested navigation items\nTop navigation bars allow you to nest navigation items by using a dropdown menu. In Figure 17.6 the “People” navigation item, is now a dropdown menu that features links to Staff and Students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.6: Nested items in navbar using a dropdown menu\n\n\n\nTo create a dropdown menu, create a navigation item that has a menu property. In the menu property list the dropdown options as navigation items:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nwebsite:\n  title: Drake Lab\n  navbar:\n    logo: d-lab.svg\n    left: \n      - blog.qmd\n    right:\n      - projects.qmd\n      - text: People\n        menu:\n          - text: Staff\n            href: faculty.qmd\n          - students.qmd\n    tools:\n      - href: https://github.com\n        icon: github\n\n\n\n17.5.2.2 Omitting navigation\nIf you specify a top navigation bar, it will be included on all pages in your site. To omit the navigation bar from a specific page set navbar: false in the document header:\n\n\ndashboard.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: Dashboard\nformat: dashboard\nnavbar: false\n---\n\n\n\n\n17.5.3 Side Navigation\nFigure 17.7 illustrates a side navigation bar that includes a logo, search box, and navigation links arranged as contents and tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.7: Components of a side navigation bar (sidebar)\n\n\n\nThe configuration to create this navigation is shown in Snippet 17.2.\n\n\n\nSnippet 17.2: The configuration for the navigation bar in Figure 17.7\n\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nwebsite:\n  title: Drake Lab\n  sidebar:  \n    logo: d-lab-dark.svg\n    contents: \n      - blog.qmd\n      - projects.qmd\n      - people.qmd\n    tools:\n      - href: https://github.com\n        icon: github\n\n\n\n\nThis example demonstrates the options to sidebar that control the contents of the navigation bar. These options are described further in Table 17.5.\n\n\n\nTable 17.5: Contents options for sidebar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ncontents\nArray of navigation items (Section 17.5.1). Create nested items using section (Section 17.5.3.1).\n\n\ntools\nAn array of navigation items displayed only using their icons, positioned at the top of the sidebar after the logo and/or title.\n\n\ntitle\nIf title is unspecified under sidebar it will inherit from the title field under website. You can specify title explicitly under sidebar if you want different title text, or set title: false under sidebar to omit it (e.g. you might if your logo contains the same text). Omitted from the sidebar if a logo is specified, as it is in Snippet 17.2.\n\n\nlogo\nAn image (.svg, .png, .jpg etc.) to include at the top of the navigation bar. Set logo-alt to specify the alternative text for the logo. Set logo-href if you want the logo to link to somewhere other than index.html.\n\n\nsearch\nInclude a search box (true or false). If there is already a search box on the top navigation bar it won’t be displayed on the sidebar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are additional options to sidebar that control its behavior and appearance described in Table 17.6. There are also background and foreground options to control the colors in the navigation bar, but unless these are the only color customizations you’ll do, we recommend using the methods outlined in Section 17.6 instead.\n\n\n\nTable 17.6: Behavior and appearance options for sidebar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nstyle\nfloating, the default, places the sidebar close to the main body text without a distinct background. docked places the sidebar near the left hand side of the page and uses a distinct background color.\n\n\ntype\ndark or light (hint to make sure the text color is the inverse of the background).\n\n\nborder\nWhether to show a border on the sidebar. true or false.\n\n\nalignment\nAlignment (left, right, or center).\n\n\ncollapse-level\nWhether to show sidebar navigation collapsed by default. The default is 2, which shows the top and next level fully expanded (but leaves the 3rd and subsequent levels collapsed).\n\n\npinned\nAlways show a title bar that expands to show the sidebar at narrower screen widths (true or false). Defaults to false, and uses headroom.js to automatically show the navigation bar when the user scrolls up on the page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.5.3.1 Nested navigation\nSide navigation bars allow you create nested navigation with expandable sections. Figure 17.8 gives an example where the “Projects” item from Figure 17.7 is now a section that contains two links: “Current” and “Past”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.8: Nested navigation in sidebar using a section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnippet 17.3: Configuration for a sidebar with nested navigation\n\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nwebsite:\n  title: Drake Lab\n  sidebar:\n    logo: d-lab-dark.svg\n    contents: \n      - blog.qmd\n      - section: Projects\n        contents:\n          - current.qmd\n          - past.qmd\n      - people.qmd\n    tools:\n      - href: https://github.com\n        icon: github\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a section, add an item to contents that has a section and contents property (Snippet 17.3).\nThe contents inside a section can contain navigation items, or more sections, allowing you to create deeply nested navigation ( Snippet 17.4, Figure 17.9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.9: Nested navigation in sidebar using a section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnippet 17.4: A sidebar configuration that has three levels in the navigation hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nwebsite:\n  title: Drake Lab\n  sidebar:\n    logo: d-lab-dark.svg\n    contents: \n      - blog.qmd\n      - section: Projects\n        contents:\n          - section: Current\n            contents:\n              - air-quality.qmd\n              - wastewater.qmd\n          - past.qmd\n      - people.qmd\n    tools:\n      - href: https://github.com\n        icon: github\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.5.3.2 Automatic side navigation\nRather than specifying navigation items, you can get Quarto to build your navigation items automatically from the content of your website project. To build a navigation menu based on the complete contents of your project set contents to auto at the top-level of sidebar:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nwebsite:\n  sidebar:\n    contents: auto\n\nThe generated navigation will include items for all the Quarto documents in your project, and respect your project’s structure by nesting your documents in sections that follow your folder’s names. For example, a website the structure shown in Figure 17.10 generates the side navigation bar shown in Figure 17.11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n├── _quarto.yml\n├── blog.qmd\n├── index.qmd\n├── people\n│   ├── faculty.qmd\n│   └── students.qmd\n└── projects\n    ├── current\n    │   ├── air-quality.qmd\n    │   └── wastewater.qmd\n    └── past\n        └── index.qmd\n\n\nFigure 17.10: The file and folder structure for the website that generates the automatic side navigation menu shown in Figure 17.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.11: Automatically generated side navigation bar for the project shown in Figure 17.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also generate parts of your navigation automatically, by specifying a directory name or glob pattern. See the Quarto documentation on Auto Generation for more examples.\n\n\n17.5.3.3 Omitting navigation\nIf you only specify a single sidebar under sidebar, and it has no explicit title or id, it will appear on every page. You can omit it from a particular page in the document header:\n\n\ndashboard.qmd\n\n---\ntitle: Dashboard\nformat: dashboard\nsidebar: false\n---\n\n\n\n17.5.3.4 Controlling side navigation by page\nYou can specify multiple side navigation bars by passing sidebar an array, allowing you to have different side navigation on different pages. When sidebar is an array, the element that is displayed on a page will be (in order of precedence):\n\nThe sidebar id specified with sidebar in the document header:\n\n\npage.qmd\n\n---\nsidebar: main\n---\n\nThe sidebar in which a link to the document is a navigation item.\nNo sidebar at all.\n\nFor example, consider the following side navigation configuration:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nwebsite:\n  title: Drake Lab\n  sidebar:\n    - title: Research\n      id: research\n      contents:\n        - project-1.qmd\n        - project-2.qmd\n    - title: Teaching\n      id: teaching\n      contents: \n        - course-1.qmd\n        - course-2.qmd\n    - title: Drake Lab\n      id: main\n      contents:\n        - index.qmd\n        - about.qmd\n    \n\nThe pages project-1.qmd and project-2.qmd will get the research sidebar containing links to each other. Similarly, course-1.qmd and course-2.qmd will get the teaching sidebar containing links to each other. The home page (index.qmd), about page (about.qmd), will get the mainsidebar.\nAny other page in the site will get no sidebar, unless they explicitly set one in their header. For example, you might have another course page, course-3.qmd, you want to also have the teaching sidebar:\n\n\ncourse-3.qmd\n\n---\nsidebar: teaching\n---\n\n\n\n\n17.5.4 Hybrid navigation\nHybrid navigation combines a top navigation bar with multiple side navigation bars. Links in the top bar, take users to a section of the website with its own side navigation.\nFor example, the Quarto documentation site uses hybrid navigation to separate the documentation into, for instance, Guide and Reference (Figure 17.12). Pages in the Guide share a sidebar, but that sidebar is different to that shared by pages in the Reference. Users navigate to the Guide or Reference using the top navigation bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPage in the Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nPage in the Reference\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.12: Hybrid navigation on the Quarto documentation site. Guide pages share sidebar navigation, which is different to the sidebar on Reference pages.\n\n\n\nTo implement hybrid navigation you combine a navbar with an array of sidebars, linking the text of navbar items to the title of the sidebar items.\nFor example, you might have a navbar that links to Teaching and Research sections:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nwebsite:\n  title: Drake Lab\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - text: Research           \n        href: research.qmd          \n      - text: Teaching\n        href: teaching.qmd\n\nFor each section to have its own sidebar, sidebar should be an array (i.e. elements prefaced with -), and the title of each item should match the text from an item in the navbar:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nwebsite:\n  title: Drake Lab\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - text: Research            \n        href: research.qmd          \n      - text: Teaching\n        href: teaching.qmd\n  sidebar:\n    - title: Research               \n      contents:\n        - research.qmd\n        - project-1.qmd\n        - project-2.qmd \n    - title: Teaching\n      contents: \n        - teaching.qmd\n        - course-1.qmd\n        - course-2.qmd\n\n\n\n17.5.5 Other navigation elements\nTable 17.7 summarizes other navigation elements beyond the top bar and side bar. We’ve included sidebar and navbar for completeness.\n\n\n\nTable 17.7: Website navigation elements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElement\n\nOption\n\n\n\n\nTop navigation\nNavigation bar that appears at top of page\nSee Section 17.5.2\n\nnavbar:\n\nunder website in _quarto.yml\ndisable for a page in document header\n\n\n\nSide navigation\nNavigation bar that appears on the left side of page\nSee Section 17.5.3\n\nsidebar:\n\nunder website in _quarto.yml\ndisable for a page in document header\n\n\n\nSearch\nSearch box that appears in top or side navigation\n\nsearch:\n\nset options under website in _quarto.yml\nenable/disable under navbar or sidebar, nested in website in _quarto.yml\n\n\n\nBreadcrumbs\nLinks above page title that indicate location in sidebar hierarchy\n\nbreadcrumbs:\n\nunder website in _quarto.yml\nin document header\n\n\n\nBack to top\nLink at the bottom of page to return to the top of the page\n\nback-to-top-navigation:\n\nunder website in _quarto.yml\nin document header\n\n\n\nPage footer\nContent to put in footer on all pages\n\npage-footer under website in _quarto.yml\n\n\nPage navigation\nLinks at the bottom of page to previous and next page (as defined in sidebar)\n\npage-navigation:\n\nunder website in _quarto.yml\nin document header\n\n\n\nTable of contents\nA table of contents to navigate sections within a page, usually shown on right\n\ntoc,toc-depth, toc-expand, toc-title, toc-location:\n\n_quarto.yml (under format:html or at top-level)\nin document header\n\n\n\nGitHub links\nLinks to Github for the page source, to edit the page source, or open an issue.\n\nrepo-url and repo-actions under website in _quarto.yml\n\n\nOther formats\nLinks to other formats shown below table of contents\n\nformat:\n\nin _quarto.yml\nin document header\n\nformat-links:\n\nin _quarto.yml\nin document header\n\n\n\nOther links\nLinks listed below table of contents in the “Code Links” or “Other Links” sections\n\ncode-links, other-links, usually, in document header.",

    "text": "17.6 Website theming\nWe use the term theme to describe the visual appearance of your site — things like colors, borders and typography. Because a website is a collection of HTML documents, you control your website theme the same way you control the theme of HTML documents. Since you usually want a consistent theme across all your pages, you’ll specify these HTML document theme options globally in _quarto.yml.\nThe easiest option is to use a built-in theme. If that doesn’t give you enough customization try brand.yml. And finally, if you need even more control provide your own CSS or SCSS file.\n\n17.6.1 Built-in themes\nIn the HTML format the theme option controls theming for individual pages. To set a theme for your website, apply one of the built-in themes to every document by setting theme in _quarto.yml:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: lux\n\nThe built-in themes for Quarto come from Bootswatch — which is the best place to see what they look like.\n\n17.6.1.1 Dark mode\nYou can specify the properties light and dark to theme to add a light/dark toggle (Figure Figure 17.13):\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: \n      dark: cyborg\n      light: lux\n\nThe property you list first (light or dark) will be the default for the page. Viewers can then switch themes via a toggle in the navigation bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipChoose light and dark themes that are similar except for color\n\n\n\nIt’s a good idea to choose themes that are as similar as possible in fonts, padding and other visual elements. This ensures minimal visual disruption as people toggle themes. Another option to maintain visual consistency, is to use a single theme, but apply a light and dark brand (see Section 17.6.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlux used as the light theme\n\n\n\n\n\ncyborg used as the dark theme\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.13: A website with built-in themes applied to light and dark\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.6.2 brand.yml\nIf you want a custom set of colors and fonts, the easiest approach is through brand.yml. Add a _brand.yml file at the root of your website (i.e. alongside _quarto.yml), and it will apply to all pages.\nIn particular, the most salient colors on a website are controlled by the color variables background, foreground, and primary:\n\n\n_brand.yml\n\ncolor:\n  foreground: \"#E0EFDE\"\n  background: \"#162627\" \n  primary: \"#8A7090\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.14: Using brand to set background, foreground and primary\n\n\n\nAs you can see in Figure 17.14 primary is used in the top navigation bar and for links. In this example, primary doesn’t have great contrast with the background for text. You can set explicit link text color with the link option to typography:\n\n\n_brand.yml\n\ncolor:\n  foreground: \"#E0EFDE\"\n  background: \"#162627\" \n  primary: \"#8A7090\"\ntypography: \n  link: \n    color: \"#d0a8d8\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.15: Specifying a link color in addition to background, foreground and primary\n\n\n\nFigure 17.15 illustrates a much better contrast between the link and body background.\nAs soon as you start having a few colors, you should set a color palette to name your colors. This makes it easier to use each color in multiple places:\n\n\n_brand.yml\n\ncolor:\n  palette:\n    mint: \"#E0EFDE\"\n    charcoal: \"#162627\" \n    light-charcoal: \"#243e3f\" \n    purple: \"#8A7090\"\n    light-purple: \"#d0a8d8\"\n  foreground: mint\n  background: charcoal\n  primary: purple\ntypography: \n  link: \n    color: light-purple\n\nIf you do alter background, and your pages include code blocks, you’ll generally also want to change the colors used for code with the typography settings for monospace-inline and monospace-block (Figure 17.16):\n\n\n_brand.yml\n\ncolor:\n  palette:\n    mint: \"#E0EFDE\"\n    charcoal: \"#162627\" \n    light-charcoal: \"#243e3f\" \n    purple: \"#8A7090\"\n    light-purple: \"#d0a8d8\"\n  foreground: mint\n  background: charcoal\n  primary: purple\ntypography: \n  link: \n    color: light-purple\n  monospace-inline:\n    color: light-purple\n    background-color: light-charcoal\n  monospace-block:\n    background-color: light-charcoal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.16: The color of inline code set to light purple, and the background inline code and code blocks set to a lighter version of the main background\n\n\n\nbrand.yml is particularly nice for customizing fonts because all you need is the name of a Google Font. Here’s an example setting the main font (base), the font used for headings of any level (headings), and the font used for code (monospace) (Figure 17.17):\n\n\n_brand.yml\n\ncolor:\n  palette:\n    mint: \"#E0EFDE\"\n    charcoal: \"#162627\" \n    light-charcoal: \"#243e3f\" \n    purple: \"#8A7090\"\n    light-purple: \"#d0a8d8\"\n  foreground: mint\n  background: charcoal\n  primary: purple\ntypography: \n  fonts:\n    - family: Chango\n      source: google\n    - family: Abel\n      source: google\n    - family: JetBrains Mono\n  base: Abel\n  headings: Chango\n  link: \n    color: light-purple\n  monospace: JetBrains Mono\n  monospace-inline:\n    color: light-purple\n    background-color: light-charcoal\n  monospace-block:\n    background-color: light-charcoal\n\nSwap source: google for source: bunny if you’d prefer Bunny Fonts—a GDPR compliant alternative to Google Fonts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.17: Specifying Google Fonts for headings, body text and code\n\n\n\nYou can also specify logo in brand.yml as an alternative way to include a logo in top or side navigation. However, if you aren’t using brand.yml across projects, or formats, it may be easier to specify it directly in _quarto.yml as shown in Section 17.5.\nYou can read about all the options available in the Quarto documentation Guide to using brand.yml.\n\n17.6.2.1 Dark mode\nTo specify a light and dark theme, and add a light/dark toggle to your site, you can specify two brand files in your website configuration:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nbrand:\n  dark: _brand.yml\n  light: _brand-light.yml\n\nWhere _brand.yml might, as it does above, define a dark mode with a charcoal background and mint text, and _brand-light.yml defines a light mode with a mint background with charcoal text:\n\n\n_brand-light.yml\n\ncolor:\n  palette:\n    mint: \"#E0EFDE\"\n    light-mint: \"#EFF7EE\"\n    charcoal: \"#162627\" \n    light-charcoal: \"#243e3f\" \n    purple: \"#8A7090\"\n    light-purple: \"#d0a8d8\"\n  foreground: charcoal\n  background: mint\n  primary: purple\ntypography: \n  link: \n    color: purple\n  monospace-inline:\n    color: purple\n    background-color: light-mint\n  monospace-block:\n    background-color: light-mint\n  \n\n\n\n\n17.6.3 Combine brand.yml with a built-in theme\nIf you want to borrow some features of a built-in theme but use custom colors, you can layer brand with a theme. For example, you might like the upper-case headings and square corners of the lux theme, but you want to use your own colors.\nTo apply your brand file on top of a built-in theme, you’ll need to specify their order in theme:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: [lux, brand]\n\n\n\n_brand.yml\n\ncolor:\n  palette:\n    mint: \"#E0EFDE\"\n    charcoal: \"#162627\" \n    light-charcoal: \"#243e3f\" \n    purple: \"#8A7090\"\n    light-purple: \"#d0a8d8\"\n  foreground: mint\n  background: charcoal\n  primary: purple\ntypography: \n  link: \n    color: light-purple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.18: A brand applied over the lux built-in theme\n\n\n\nDepending on the built-in theme, you may need to be more explicit in your brand file. For example, the theme lux, explicitly sets a color for headings which doesn’t work well with a dark background (Figure 17.18). This explicit value wins over the implicit inheritance from base in the brand file. You can fix it by specifying headings explicitly in the brand file (Figure 17.19):\n\n\n_brand.yml\n\ncolor:\n  palette:\n    mint: \"#E0EFDE\"\n    charcoal: \"#162627\" \n    light-charcoal: \"#243e3f\" \n    purple: \"#8A7090\"\n    light-purple: \"#d0a8d8\"\n  foreground: mint\n  background: charcoal\n  primary: purple\ntypography: \n  link: \n    color: light-purple\n  headings:\n    color: mint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.19: Explicitly setting heading color to override lux\n\n\n\n\n17.6.3.1 Dark mode\nIf you have a light and dark brand, you can also layer them with a built-in theme. In your website configuration, you’ll specify your brand file under the light and dark properties for brand, and their layering with a built-in theme in the light and dark properties of theme:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nbrand:\n  dark: _brand.yml\n  light: _brand-light.yml\n  \nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: \n      dark: [lux, brand]\n      light: [lux, brand]\n\nWhen you layer light and dark brands with built-in themes, you’ll likely find a number of places the colors don’t quite work. In that case, you’ll likely need to make some color tweaks with CSS/SCSS.\n\n\n\n17.6.4 Adding CSS or SCSS\nCSS and SCSS are languages for specifying how HTML documents should look visually. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the older and more verbose language. SCSS (a variant of SASS, Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is like CSS with superpowers adding things like variables, nested rules, and mixins.\nThe options for theming you’ve seen so far, using built-in themes and brand.yml, are implemented with SCSS, which is ultimately translated to CSS for a web browser to display. Quarto gives you two opportunities to inject your own rules in this process:\n\nAdding a CSS file to the rendered document using css.\nInserting a SCSS file into Quarto’s SCSS layering system with theme.\n\nYou won’t learn the details of CSS or SCSS in this book, but we’ll show you a couple of examples of the kinds of customization they allow beyond built-in themes and brand.yml.\n\n17.6.4.1 CSS\nYou can use CSS to apply styling exceptions to specific elements in your HTML document. CSS rules consist of a selector that identifies which elements the rule applies to, and a series of declarations that describe the styling to apply to the element.\nAs an example, this rule applies to first level headings (h1) and sets the font color (color) to purple (#d0a8d8):\nh1 {\n  color: #d0a8d8;\n}\nIf you save this rule in a file called styles.css, you can apply it to your documents using the css option:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nformat:\n  html: \n    css: styles.css\n\nIn Quarto HTML documents, the h1 tag is reserved for the page title, so this has the effect of changing the color of the title, but no other headings.\nAs another example, a CSS selector can be based on an elements class. The website title in the navbar has the class .navbar-title, so a CSS rule could change the font of this title:\n.navbar-title {\n  font-family: Chango;\n}\nIf you’ve already used the same font in _brand.yml, this is enough. Otherwise, you’ll also need to include CSS to import the font:\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Chango&display=swap');\n\n.navbar-title {\n  font-family: Chango;\n}\n\n\n17.6.4.2 SCSS\nTo add SCSS to a Quarto document you need to provide a file split into sections using a special annotation. The content of these sections is then spliced into Quarto’s SCSS before it gets compiled to CSS. Adding your own SCSS allows you to set (or change) variables that affect many parts of the final CSS.\nHere, we’ll only touch on the two most commonly edited sections: rules and defaults. You can read more in the Quarto documentation on More about Quarto Themes.\n\n17.6.4.2.1 Rules (rules)\nThe rules section is the last section and contains CSS rules, but with the added benefit of SCSS features. For example, you could take a CSS rule from above, and instead place it in a SCSS file, along with the required annotation /*-- scss:rules --*/:\n\n\nstyles.scss\n\n/*-- scss:rules --*/\nh1 {\n  color: #d0a8d8;\n}\n\nTo insert this SCSS into Quarto’s SCSS layering system, you provide the file to the theme argument:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: styles.scss\n\nOne advantage of putting CSS rules in SCSS is you can use variables for values. For instance, rather than a hex code for a color, you could refer to a Quarto SCSS variable:\n\n\nstyles.scss\n\n/*-- scss:rules --*/\nh1 {\n  color: $brand-light-purple;\n}\n\nNow if you change your definition of light-purple in _brand.yml you won’t need to change it in a CSS file as well. Another advantage is being able to use functions from SASS like lighten() and darken():\n\n\nstyles.scss\n\n/*-- scss:rules --*/\nh1 {\n  color: darken($brand-mint, 10%);\n}\n\nYou can layer your custom SCSS with any other elements you might already have (Figure 17.20):\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: [lux, brand, styles.scss]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.20: A website the adds a rule via SCSS to set page titles to a darker mint.\n\n\n\n\n\n17.6.4.2.2 Defaults (defaults)\nThe defaults section comes earlier than rules and is used to set the values of variables. You can use it to define your own variables to use later, or more commonly to override Quarto’s SCSS variables.\nFor example, Quarto provides SCSS variables to alter the size of the different heading levels. You could shrink the second level headings a little from the default with:\n\n\nstyles.scss\n\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n$h2-font-size: 1.5em;\n\nAll the available SCSS variables are listed in the Quarto documentation under Sass Variables. Many of the SCSS variables duplicate the functionality you get via brand.yml. For websites, the variables that are most useful are those around navigation. In particular, navbar-bg, navbar-fg, navbar-hl, control the color of the top navigation bar background, text (e.g. foreground), and text on hover, and sidebar-bg, sidebar-fg, and sidebar-hl do the same for the side navigation bar.\nAs an example, you might want to override brand.yml selection of primary for the navigation bar (Figure 17.21):\n\n\nstyles.scss\n\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n$navbar-bg: \"#E0EFDE\";\n$navbar-fg: \"#162627\";\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.21: Overriding the navigation bar color set by brand with SCSS\n\n\n\nIf you want to refer to your brand colors in the defaults section, you’ll need to layer your SCSS higher in theme so that the brand variables are defined by the point you want to use them. For example, to achieve the same result as above, but without re-specifying the hex colors, you could have:\n\n\nstyles.scss\n\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n$navbar-bg: $brand-mint;\n$navbar-fg: $brand-charcoal;\n\nHowever, you need to put styles.scss in theme first:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: [styles.scss, brand]\n\n\n\n17.6.4.2.3 Control SCSS in brand.yml\nAn alternative to a custom SCSS file, is to specify SCSS in the defaults: bootstrap section of _brand.yml. The names of the options to bootstrap correspond to the sections in Quarto SCSS files, with the additional convenience that defaults can take a mapping of SCSS variables to values.\nFigure 17.22 shows a side-by-side comparison of using brand.yml versus a custom SCSS file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstyles.scss\n\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n$navbar-fg: $brand-charcoal;\n$navbar-bg: $brand-mint;\n\n/*-- scss:rules --*/\nh1 {\n  color: $brand-light-purple;\n}\n\n.navbar-title {\n  font-family: Chango;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n_brand.yml\n\ndefaults:\n  bootstrap:\n    defaults: \n      navbar-bg: $brand-mint\n      navbar-fg: $brand-charcoal\n    rules: |\n      h1 {\n        color: $brand-light-purple;\n      }\n      .navbar-title {\n        font-family: Chango;\n      }\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.22: Equivalent SCSS supplied as a custom SCSS file, versus in _brand.yml.\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying SCSS in _brand.yml means you only have one file to copy to apply the same style to another project, however, you lose the SCSS language support your IDE might provide to a .scss file.\n\n\n\n\n17.6.5 The role of Bootstrap\nBootstrap is a framework that helps make websites and web documents look polished and responsive without requiring extensive custom CSS. Quarto uses Bootstrap to implement layout, so that pages look good on both mobile and desktop devices, and to implement elements like callouts and navigation bars. As a Quarto user you don’t need to know anything about Bootstrap, but knowing a little opens up some ways to further customize your site.\n\n17.6.5.1 Bootstrap classes\nBootstrap exposes a ton of CSS classes to style elements. Because Quarto HTML documents use Bootstrap, you can use these Bootstrap classes within your own documents.\nAs an example, Bootstrap includes a button component:\n&lt;a class=\"btn btn-primary\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;\nThe key information is in class. To make a link look like a button, use the usual syntax, but add the classes prefaced by a . in curly braces:\n[See Source](http://github.com){.btn .btn-primary}\nWhen rendered, you’ll get a link that looks like a button:\n\nSee Source\n\nYou’ll need to pay attention to the kind of object Bootstrap classes apply to and match to the appropriate Quarto syntax. Table 17.8 gives some examples of applying Bootstrap classes to a span, div, and table.\n\n\n\nTable 17.8: Examples of Bootstrap classes used in Quarto markdown syntax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nClass\nElement\nQuarto Markdown\nRendered\n\n\n\n\nBadge\nbadge\n&lt;span&gt;\n### Example heading [New]{.badge .text-bg-primary}\n\nExample heading New\n\n\n\nBorder Utility\nborder , rounded and more\n&lt;div&gt;\nAlso applies to &lt;span&gt;, and &lt;img&gt;\n::: {.border .rounded .border-primary .p-2}\n\nSome content\n\n:::\n\nSome content\n\n\n\nAccented Tables\ntable-striped\n&lt;table&gt;\n|       |\n|-------|\n| Row 1 |\n| Row 2 |\n\n: {.table-striped}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRow 1\n\n\nRow 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.6.5.2 Bootstrap SCSS variables\nBootstrap uses SCSS variables, like Quarto does, to control aspects of the many CSS rules in a single place. Assuming neither Quarto, nor your theme, overrides them, you can set them yourself just like Quarto SCSS variables.\nFor example, by setting border-width and border-style you can affect all borders added by the border class:\n\n\nstyles.scss\n\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n$border-width: 2px;\n$border-style: dashed;\n\nYou can find a list of the Bootstrap SCSS variables available by examining the bootstrap/dist/scss/_variables.scss file in the Quarto source code.",

    "text": "17.9 Publishing a website\nTo get your website out to your audience you’ll need to publish it somewhere. In this section, you’ll first learn about website metadata you’ll likely want to set before publishing that will make it easier for people to find and share your website. Then, you’ll learn about the most common approaches to publishing your site: the quarto publish command or hosting the _site folder.\n\n17.9.1 Website metadata\nBefore you publish your website, you’ll want to make sure you’ve set some website metadata (Snippet 17.6):\n\ntitle and description are generally what a search engine will display if your site is returned in a search. title is also added to page titles to provide the tab label in a browser.\nsite-url should be set to the address for your hosted website. A number of Quarto features rely on this being set, but most relevantly, you can’t use relative links for image without it.\nSet open-graph and/or twitter-card to true to have Quarto add the metadata required to provide previews when you share your URL in social apps.\nProvide image a path to the image you want to be used in social cards. This image will be used for any page that doesn’t otherwise specify an image. Provide image-alt with alternative text for the image.\n\n\n\n\nSnippet 17.6: Metadata that will make a site easier to find and share\n\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nwebsite:\n  title: Drake Lab\n  description: A computational biology lab at Evergreen University led by Soraya Drake\n  site-url: https://www.drakelab.org\n  open-graph: true\n  image: card.png\n  image-alt: Magnified view of a cell\n\n\n\n\nAn example of a social card built from Snippet 17.6 is shown in Figure 17.25.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.25: An example social card populated by website metadata: title, description, image and image-alt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipQuarto will use the most specific metadata\n\n\n\nYou can define title, description and image/image-alt at the website level in _quarto.yml, or in document metadata. Quarto will prefer the document metadata, but fall back to website metadata if document values aren’t set.\n\n\n\n\n17.9.2 quarto publish\nYou saw how to use quarto publish in ?sec-publishing. To publish a website using quarto publish simply run Quarto publish from the project root:\nquarto publish\nThis will prompt you to select a provider and to authenticate. Then Quarto runs quarto render one more time (you can disable this with --no-render), pushes the _site/ directory to the provider, then opens the site in your browser (you can disable this with --no-browser). This process is illustrated in Figure 17.26. We’ve separated out the “render” and “publish” step, but both steps happen when you call quarto publish.\nAfter publishing, you’ll find a _publish.yml file in your website project which records the details of where you published. If you publish again, you’ll be asked if you want to publish an update to the destinations recorded in this file, or to a new destination.\nThe publish command is primary just moving _site/ to the right place on your provider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.26: The quarto publish process for a website. The website project is rendered locally, then the rendered site, site/ (or docs/), is uploaded to the website host.\n\n\n\n\n\n17.9.3 Publish _site/\nOnce you’ve rendered your website, the _site/ folder contains everything needed for your website. So, if your website host isn’t supported by quarto publish, you simply need to get the contents of _site/ to your provider. It you go this route, you’ll always need to manually run a full render before transferring _site/. From the root of your website project run:\nquarto render\nAs a concrete example, Netlify (although also supported by quarto publish) has a drag and drop UI for deploying a website called Netlify Drop. Drop in _site/, and Netlify will give you a URL at which your site is available.\n\n\n17.9.4 Providers\nThe quarto publish command supports several publishing providers. The three we think are most useful if you are choosing for yourself are Quarto Pub, GitHub Pages, and Netlify. A brief summary comparing their features is shown in Table 17.9.\n\n\n\nTable 17.9: A comparison of three popular publishing providers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvider\nPrivate Source\nPrivate Site\nCustom Domain\n\n\n\n\nQuarto Pub\n✔️\n✖️\n✖️\n\n\nGitHub\nPaid plans\nGitHub Enterprise Cloud only\n✔️\n\n\nNetlify\n✔️\nPaid plans\n✔️\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can specify the provider directly in the call to quarto publish:\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto publish quarto-pub\n\n\n17.9.4.1 GitHub Pages\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto publish gh-pages\n\nGitHub Pages is a hosting service provided by GitHub at the repository level. If you are storing your source on GitHub anyway, it makes sense to also publish via GitHub Pages.\nWhen you publish, Quarto creates a special gh-pages branch, renders your document or project to this branch, and pushes this branch to GitHub. This branch is then processed on GitHub’s side, making it available at a URL of the form { user }.github.io/repo-name.\nIf you use GitHub through one of its “Free” plans you can only use GitHub Pages on public repositories. If you’d prefer your source documents weren’t available publicly you’ll either need to upgrade your GitHub plan, or use something like Netlify or Quarto Pub instead.\nYou can read more about publishing to GitHub with quarto publish on the GitHub Pages page in the Quarto documentation.\nAn alternative to using quarto publish is to commit your rendered document or site to your repository in a docs/ folder and set GitHub Pages to publish from there. You can read more about this workflow at Render to docs on the Quarto documentation website.\n\n\n17.9.4.2 Netlify\n\n\nTerminal\n\nquarto publish netlify\n\nNetlify provides services for building, deploying, and managing websites. When you publish to Netlify using quarto publish, your document or site will be set up as what Netlify calls a manual deploy — you deploy by manually running quarto publish. Your output files are sent to Netlify and Netlify serves them at a URL of the form { random identifier }.netlify.app.\nYou can manage your deployed site via Netlify’s website, and Netlify includes some neat features like one-click rollbacks to a previously deployed site, and the ability to use a custom domain. Netlify’s free plans limit how many sites you can have and how much bandwidth is used to serve them. However, these limits will likely not be reached for low-traffic personal sites.\nRather than using quarto publish you can get Netlify to deploy from Git provider. In this workflow, you commit your rendered document or site to your repository in a folder (e.g. docs/ or _site/) and connect Netlify to your Git provider, setting the folder as the Publish directory. You can read more about this on the Quarto documentation website at Publish from a Git Provider.\nNetlify excels in continuous integration and you can set it up to preview deployments based on branches or pull requests. These features require a more complicated publishing setup you’ll learn about in Section 17.10.\n\n\n17.9.4.3 Other providers\nYou are most likely to use Posit Connect or Confluence in organizational settings where your IT department will manage them. Hugging Face has a more complicated setup and probably only makes sense if you are using Hugging Face beyond Quarto already.\nYou can read more about the details of publishing in the Publishing Guide on the Quarto documentation website.",

    "section": "17.10 Continuous integration",
    "text": "17.10 Continuous integration\nThe methods discussed in Section 17.9 involve you manually invoking publishing, e.g. by running quarto publish. Continuous integration is a term for an automatic publishing process where publishing is triggered by some other event. That event might an action like pushing to a GitHub repository, or be based on a schedule.\nWhen talking about continuous integration there could be up to three other parties involved: the host for your source code (usually in a Git repo), the provider of the continuous integration service, and the publishing venue. They might all be the same. For example, you might host your source code on GitHub, implement continuous integration with GitHub Actions, and publish to GitHub Pages. However they don’t have to be. For instance, you might host your source code on GitHub, and use GitHub Actions, but publish to Netlify.\nWhen you automate publishing, you’ll need to consider where you want code execution and rendering to occur, locally or on a remote server.\nYour options are:\n\nLocal code execution and rendering: you manage your computational environment (R, Python, Julia etc), and Quarto installation locally, and manually run quarto render. Your CI service handles publishing to the web, usually by monitoring changes to a Git repo.\nLocal code execution with remote rendering: you manage your computational environment (R, Python, Julia etc) locally, and use _freeze/ to store the results of the computational engine. You set up your CI service to install Quarto and run quarto render and publish.\nRemote code execution and remote rendering: your CI service needs to install and set up your computational environment, install Quarto, run quarto render, and publish.\n\nTable 17.10 compares these three options for a minimal website with the file structure:\n├── _quarto.yml\n└── index.qmd\nIn all three cases, the final outcome is the contents of _site/ is hosted on the publishing provider:\n_site/\n├── index.html\n└── site_libs\n\n\n\nTable 17.10: Continuous integration options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode/Render\nOn your computer\nIn the repo\nOn CI\nTools required on CI\n\n\n\n\nLocal/Local\nquarto render\nwebsite/\n├──_site/\n├──_quarto.yml\n└──index.qmd\nWhen triggered,\ndeploys _site\n\nNone\n\n\n\nLocal/Remote\nquarto render\nwebsite/\n├──_freeze/\n├──_quarto.yml\n└──index.qmd\nWhen triggered,\nrenders based on _freeze,\nand publishes.\nE.g. quarto publish\n\nQuarto CLI\n\n\n\nRemote/Remote\nNothing required.\n\nwebsite/\n├──_quarto.yml\n└──index.qmd\nWhen triggered,\nrenders\nand publishes.\nE.g. quarto publish\n\nQuarto CLI\nR/Python/Julia and required packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.10.1 Local code execution and local render\nWhen you execute code locally and render locally, _site/ contains all of the required website source. One approach to automating publishing is to check your website source into version control and let a provider handle the automation. From your perspective, you run quarto render locally, then push the changes to your repository. Your provider then updates the deployed site.\nThis approach is the easiest to set up—you generally don’t need to do anything except connect your repo to your CI service. However, you can end up with commits with large diffs (the changes to the source documents, and all the changes to the rendered output in _site/ or docs/). These large diffs are cumbersome to review, and take longer to send to your Git remote host.\nTwo examples of this approach are:\n\nGithub deploy from docs/ (as described in Section 17.9.4.1). GitHub is the host for your source code, the provider of the CI and the publishing venue.\nNetlify deploy from a Git provider (as described in Section 17.9.4.2). Any supported Git provider is the host for your source code, and Netlify is the CI provider and publishing venue.\n\nAlternatively, you could set up your own automation (e.g. via GitHub Actions) that deploys your content on any push to your repo.\n\n\n17.10.2 Local code execution and remote render\nLocal code execution, with remote rendering provides a good middle ground. You aren’t burdened with setting up, and maintaining a remote code execution environment, but you also don’t have to store a whole lot of rendered output in your repo.\nThis approach requires using freeze (Chapter 9) to store the results of the code execution. You run quarto render locally, as required, to generate _freeze/. You then check _freeze/, but not _site/, into version control. Your CI agent then uses the Quarto CLI to render and publish your site.\nThe most common CI service for this approach is GitHub. The project source is stored in a GitHub repo, and a GitHub Action is used to setup Quarto, and run the required Quarto commands. The Quarto command could be as simple as quarto publish {venue}, which allows your publishing venue to be any of those supported by quarto publish.\n\n\n17.10.3 Remote code execution and remote render\nRemote code execution combined with remote rendering provides the most protection for keeping your work reproducible—your CI will fail as soon as it isn’t. However, it comes with the most setup, maintenance, and cost (time and potentially money) since all the work is happening on a remote server.\nYou now only check your source documents (e.g. .qmd files) into version control. Your CI service needs to install your computational environment, so you likely will also create and check-in a record of the packages required (e.g. using renv for R, or requirements.txt, pipenv, or uv for Python). When your CI runs, it will install your computational environment, install Quarto, and then run a full render and publish.\nThe two most popular choices for CI provider in this case are GitHub Actions, and Posit Connect Cloud. In both cases your source code is hosted on GitHub.\nPosit Connect Cloud has the advantage of very little setup. You simply connect your repo to your Connect Cloud account, and Connect Cloud handles the automation, including managing your computational environment for common R and Python setups.\nYou’ll learn more about GitHub Actions in the next section.\n\n\n17.10.4 GitHub Actions\nGitHub Actions are the most common method for setting up continuous integration for publishing Quarto websites. GitHub Actions are defined by a workflow, a series of steps that will be run on servers (usually GitHub’s), in the context of a GitHub repository.\nTo use GitHub Actions you necessarily need to have your website in a repository on GitHub. You then set up a workflow file, a YAML file that lives in your project in the folder .github/workflows/.\nGitHub Actions can be incredibly flexible, so rather than outline all your possibilities we’ll walk through an example and point out places you could implement more flexibility.\nConsider the workflow, publish.yml, shown in Snippet 17.7 which might be used for a project that uses local code execution with remote rendering. The workflow file sets up a single job build-deploy that consists of three steps:\n\nGet the project source by checking out the repository\nInstall the Quarto CLI\nRun quarto publish gh-pages\n\nEach of these steps is implemented by using an action defined by someone else (as specified in uses): GitHub itself in the first case, and the Quarto development team in the second and third. The definitions of these actions are also found on GitHub where you can often find more details about their use. For example, you can find about more the publish action at https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/tree/main/publish#readme.\n\n\n\nSnippet 17.7: A GitHub Action that publishes to GitHub Pages\n\n\n\n\n.github/workflows/publish.yml\n\n1on:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\n2name: Quarto Publish\n\n3jobs:\n4  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n5    steps:\n6      - name: Check out repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n7      - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n\n8      - name: Render and Publish\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: gh-pages\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n\n\n1\n\nDescribes when this workflow should trigger. In this case, on any pushes to the main branch, or manually (workflow_dispatch).\n\n2\n\nA name for the workflow displayed in GitHub Action’s UI.\n\n3\n\nA workflow can have one or more jobs that run in parallel. Most Quarto CI workflows have a single job.\n\n4\n\nA job identifier and settings including permissions and the type of machine the job runs on. This workflow needs write permissions because it will write to the gh-pages branch to publish the site.\n\n5\n\nThe meat of the job is a series of steps to be run in order.\n\n6\n\nCheck out the project repository onto the machine.\n\n7\n\nInstall the Quarto CLI. Uses the latest release by default.\n\n8\n\nRuns quarto publish {target} (by default includes a full quarto render). Depending on your target you’ll need to set some environment variables with your credentials on your publishing venue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree common ways you might customize this workflow are as follows:\n\nSpecify a different publishing target. Swap out target: gh-pages for one of the other supported publishing venues. You’ll also need to set a different token in env with your credentials on the publishing venue.\nAdd steps that set up a computational environment. If you also want remote code execution, you’ll need to add instructions to set up your computational environment before the “Render and Publish” step. You can see two examples in Snippet 17.8 for R combined with renv, and Snippet 17.9 for Python combined with pip.\nSplit rendering and publishing. If you are publishing to a venue that isn’t supported by quarto publish, you might split up the “Render and Publish” step. You could use the quarto-dev/quarto-actions/render action to render your site. Then add a custom step for the deployment, using actions from someone like Netlify, or your own custom commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnippet 17.8: Setup R\n\n\n\n\n.github/workflows/publish.yml\n\n      - name: Install R\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2\n        with:\n          r-version: '4.4.3'\n\n      - name: Install R Dependencies\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2\n        with:\n          cache-version: 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnippet 17.9: Setup Python\n\n\n\n\n.github/workflows/publish.yml\n\n      - name: Install Python and Dependencies\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n        with:\n          python-version: '3.13'\n          cache: 'pip'\n\n      - run: pip install jupyter\n      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt",

## Tables {#sec-markdown-tables}

The simplest are markdown tables, but cells in a markdown table cannot contain block content like  multiple paragraphs, code cells, or lists.
List tables provide a markdown way to get complicated cell contents.
Can also use HTML syntax, regardless of your target format, - not usually written by hand.

### Markdown tables

The simplest syntax for a table in Quarto markdown is known as the **pipe table**, named because columns are separated by the pipe (`|`) character. 
A pipe table consists of column headers, a separator row of dashes (`-`) and pipes (`|`), and data rows with pipe-separated cells.

@fig-markdown-table gives an example of a pipe table, along with its rendered output.
The line after the table, starting with `:`, is optional, and specifies the caption and any attributes for the table (inside curly braces `{}`).
For example, the table is given the ID `#tbl-perf` so it is numbered and can be cross-referenced.

::: {#fig-markdown-table}
::: {}
````markdown
{{< include _examples/authoring/tables/markdown-table.qmd >}}
````
::: 

::: {}

#### Column alignment and widths

You can add colons to the separator row to align columns to the left, right, or center.
For example, the following table aligns the first column to the left, the second column to the center, and the third column to the right:

::: {}
````markdown
{{< include _examples/authoring/tables/markdown-table-align.md >}}
````
::: 

To customize the column widths beyond the default, add a `tbl-colwidths` attribute with an array of column widths (as percentages) to the attributes after the caption.
For example, you might give the first column 80% of the width and the remaining two columns each 10% of the width:

::: {}
````markdown
{{< include _examples/authoring/tables/markdown-table-colwidths.md >}}
````
::: 

### List tables

TODO: Revisit this once the `list-tables` extension is bundled with Quarto. 

List tables use markdown list syntax to create tables where cells can contain multiple paragraphs, code cells, or lists.
List tables need to be wrapped in a fenced div with the class `list-table`.
Inside the div, each row is represented as list item, with each cell as an subitem.

For example, to create the same table content as @fig-markdown-table using a list table, you would include the following in your document:

````markdown
{{< include _examples/authoring/tables/list-table.qmd >}}
````

To add a caption and attributes nest it inside another fenced div with a label that starts with `tbl-` and whose final line is the caption:

````markdown
{{< include _examples/authoring/tables/list-table-caption.qmd >}}
````

To include more complicated content in cells, like code blocks or formulas, include them as you would in normal markdown, but maintain indentation for the list structure, and the required white space for the content type:

````markdown
{{< include _examples/authoring/tables/list-table-complicated.qmd >}}
````

### HTML tables

You can also use HTML to create tables in Quarto documents, regardless of your target format.
HTML tables aren't usually constructed by hand, but are often generated by code cells or copied from other tools.

As an example, to generate the same table as @fig-markdown-table with HTML, you could include the following in your document:

````markdown
{{< include _examples/authoring/tables/html-table.qmd >}}
````

## Figures {#sec-markdown-figures}

Basic markdown syntax for figure, figure with ID + caption + alt. 

Attributes you might put directly in the figure syntax: `fig-align`, `width`?

## Layout {#sec-layout}

Using divs with classes and/or attributes to create layouts.

`layout-*` attributes to arrange items 

`.column` classes to use parts of the page https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html#available-columns

# Authoring {#sec-authoring}

When we say "authoring" we mean the process of adding content to a Quarto document---literally, the things you write in a `.qmd` file.
More specifically, this chapter focuses on what you put in the parts of your document that are interpreted as markdown---that is, everything that isn't the document header, or an executable code cell.

Our goal is to give you a good overview of breadth of Quarto's authoring features, while delaying many of the details to later chapters of the book.
We also focus on syntax that is broadly supported across multiple output formats and cover specific format features where relevant in @sec-output-formats.

We suggest reading through the chapter in its entirety on your first reading, and then referring back to specific sections as needed when authoring your own documents.

## Markdown text

Everything that isn't the document header, or an executable code cell, is interpreted as Quarto markdown.
Quarto markdown originally built on top of Pandoc markdown with extensions, so much of Pandoc markdown works.
Now, Quarto has its own markdown parser, so some differences.
The rest of this chapter outlines the most important pieces of Quarto markdown syntax.

## Sections

Use markdown headings to structure your document into sections and subsections.
Markdown headings are created by prefixing text with one or more `#` characters, 
followed by a space, and the heading title:

```markdown
## Section

### Subsection

#### Subsubsection

```

Quarto supports six levels of headings, from level-1 (`#`) to level-6 (`######`).
The value of `title` in the document header usually becomes the level-1 heading of the document,
which is why sections usually start with level-2 headings.

You can attach attributes to headings by adding curly braces `{}` after the heading text.
For example, you might add an identifier to a section heading to enable cross-referencing:

```markdown
## Section Title {#sec-section-title}
```    

Or you might add a class, which are often used to control the behavior of sections, like `.unlisted` to exclude a section from the table of contents:

```markdown
## Section Title {#sec-section-title .unlisted}
```

::: {#tip-attributes .callout-tip}

## What are attributes?

Attributes are a way to add metadata to markdown elements, usually inside curly braces `{}` after the element.
Attributes are used extensively in Quarto to control the behavior or appearance of many elements.

The types of thing you can add as attributes include:

* Identifiers (IDs), should be unique and start with `#`
* Classes start with `.`
* Key-value pairs use `key='value'` syntax.

The order of attributes matters: identifiers must come first, followed by classes, and then key-value pairs.

:::

## Paragraphs

Create paragraphs by separating text with blank lines:

```markdown
This is the first paragraph. It can span multiple lines 
in your source document.

This is a second paragraph, separated by a blank line.
```

Line breaks within a paragraph are ignored, which means you can wrap your text across multiple lines without affecting the final rendered output.

## Text

Beyond plain text, @tbl-inline-text-elements summarizes the most common things you want to put inside a paragraph or heading: formatted text, links, cross-references, citations, math and footnotes.

These elements are called **inline text elements**, because they are used inline with text, inside what are called **block elements** like paragraphs and headings.
You can also use them inside many of the other block-level elements discussed in this chapter like as list items, inside tables, and inside callouts.

## Lists

You can create an unordered list by starting each line with `-` (or `*` or `+`) followed by a space, 
ensuring there is a blank line before the first element:

```markdown
My list:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
```

Leaving no blank lines between items will result in a compact list, while leaving a blank line between items will create a loose list with more vertical spacing.

Use numbers followed by a period to create an ordered list:

```markdown
My numbered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

The actual numbers you use don't matter---Quarto will renumber the list automatically. This means you can use `1.` for every item if you prefer.

List items can contain other block elements like paragraphs, code blocks, or even other lists. 
Subsequent elements should be indented to line up with the first non-space content after the list marker.
@fig-nested-list shows an example of a nested list, along with its rendered output.

::: {#fig-nested-list}

::: {}
````markdown
{{< include _examples/authoring/lists/nested.md >}}
````
:::

:::{}
::: {.rendered style="text-align: left;"}
{{< include _examples/authoring/lists/nested.md >}}
:::
:::

List syntax and its rendered output
:::

Quarto also supports task lists and definition lists. 
See the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#lists) for details on these specialized list types.



## Code blocks {#sec-code-blocks}

We use the term **code blocks**, as distinct from **code cells**, for code that is to be shown, but never executed.

There are two equivalent syntaxes for code blocks. 
You can use triple backticks followed by the language name:

````markdown
```sql
SELECT * FROM table;
```
````

Or use triple backticks followed by curly braces with the language name prefaced by a period:

````markdown
```{.sql}
SELECT * FROM table;
```
````

We prefer the second syntax since it's easier to add additional code block attributes.
For example,  you might add `filename` which adds a header with the filename above the code block as shown in @fig-code-block-with-filename.

::: {#fig-code-block-with-filename}
````markdown
```{.sql filename="query.sql"}
SELECT * FROM table;
```
````

```{.sql filename="query.sql"}
SELECT * FROM table;
```

Code block syntax and its rendered output 

:::

:::{.callout-tip}

## Supported code block languages 

The language for code blocks is used only for syntax highlighting.
You can see a list of supported languages by running the following command in your terminal:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto pandoc --list-highlight-style 
```

Specifying a language that isn't supported will simply result in no syntax highlighting being applied.

:::


## Tables {#sec-markdown-tables}

The simplest way to add a table to a Quarto document is to create a **markdown pipe table**, however cells in a markdown pipe table cannot contain block content like multiple paragraphs, code cells, or lists.
To have cells with complicated cell contents, you can use an alternative syntax called **list tables**.
You can also use **HTML table syntax**, regardless of your target format, to create tables in Quarto documents.
You won't usually write HTML syntax by hand, but it is a common output from computational packages that create tables.

### Markdown pipe tables

The simplest syntax for a table in Quarto markdown is known as the **pipe table**, named because columns are separated by the pipe (`|`) character. 
A pipe table consists of column headers, a separator row of dashes (`-`) and pipes (`|`), and data rows with pipe-separated cells.

@fig-markdown-table gives an example of a pipe table, along with its rendered output.
The line after the table, starting with `:`, is optional, and specifies the caption and any attributes for the table (inside curly braces `{}`).
For example, the table is given the ID `#tbl-perf` so it is numbered and can be cross-referenced.

::: {#fig-markdown-table}
::: {}
````markdown
{{< include _examples/authoring/tables/markdown-table.qmd >}}
````
::: 

::: {}
![](images/authoring-tbl-perf.png){fig-alt="Rendered markdown output shows a table titled 'Table 1: Training Performance', with three columns: 'Model', 'Accuracy', and 'Time'. The table has four rows."}
:::

:::


### List tables

TODO: Revisit this once the `list-tables` extension is bundled with Quarto. 

List tables use markdown list syntax to create tables where cells can contain multiple paragraphs, code cells, or lists.
List tables need to be wrapped in a fenced div with the class `list-table`.
Inside the div, each row is represented as list item, with each cell as an subitem.

For example, to create the same table content as @fig-markdown-table using a list table, you would include the following in your document:

````markdown
{{< include _examples/authoring/tables/list-table.qmd >}}
````

To add a caption and attributes nest it inside another fenced div with a label that starts with `tbl-` and whose final line is the caption:

````markdown
{{< include _examples/authoring/tables/list-table-caption.qmd >}}
````

To include more complicated content in cells, like code blocks or formulas, include them as you would in normal markdown, but maintain indentation for the list structure, and the required white space for the content type:

````markdown
{{< include _examples/authoring/tables/list-table-complicated.qmd >}}
````

### HTML tables

You can also use HTML to create tables in Quarto documents, regardless of your target format.
HTML tables aren't usually constructed by hand, but are often generated by code cells or copied from other tools.

As an example, to generate the same table as @fig-markdown-table with HTML, you could include the following in your document:

````markdown
{{< include _examples/authoring/tables/html-table.qmd >}}
````

### From a code cell {#sec-computational-table}

When the output from an executable code cell is a markdown or HTML table, 
it will be included in your Quarto document.

To add an identifier and caption to the table use the code cell options `label` and `tbl-cap` respectively:

````markdown
```{{LANGUAGE}}
#| label: tbl-example
#| tbl-cap: "Caption"

# Code that generates a markdown or HTML table
```
````

## Images and figures {#sec-markdown-figures}

Refer to @sec-figures for more details on positioning, layout, cross-references, and other advanced figure features.
Quarto uses the term figure to refer to any image, numbered or not, included in a document.
You may be more used to using the term figure to refer to an image with a numbered caption---Quarto calls this a cross-referenceable figure. 

### From a file

To include an image file in markdown you use the following syntax:

```markdown
![](path/to/image.png)
```

Where the path to the image is a path relative to the current document.

::: {.callout-tip}

## Project relative paths 

If you preface the path with `/`, it is interpreted as a path relative to the project root. 
You'll learn more about project structure in [Projects](#sec-projects).

:::

You can add a caption inside the square brackets, an identifier inside curly braces after the image path, and alternative text for accessibility in a `fig-alt` attribute:

```markdown
![Caption](path/to/image.png){#fig-quarto fig-alt="Alternative text"}
```

If your identifier starts with `fig-`, the image will be a cross-referenceable figure, numbered, and can be referenced using the `@` syntax.

### From a code cell {#sec-computational-figure}

If the output from an executable code cell is an image, it will be automatically included in your document.
To add an identifier, caption, or alternative text use the code cell options `label`, `fig-cap`, and `fig-alt` respectively:

````markdown
```{{LANGUAGE}}
#| label: fig-quarto
#| fig-cap: "Caption"
#| fig-alt: "Alternative text"

# Code that generates a plot
```
````

## Mathematical equations {#sec-equations}

You can include formulas and equations in your document using TeX syntax.
There are two ways to include math: **inline math**, using single `$`, appears within a line of text; while **display math**, using `$$` appears centered on its own line.
@tbl-math-examples shows examples of both.

To number and cross-reference a display equation, add an identifier starting with `eq-`, see @sec-crossreferences for more details.

    ```

## Cross-references {#sec-crossreferences}

Cross-references are automatically generated links elements within your document, like figures, tables, sections, and equations. 
When you render your document, Quarto automatically numbers these elements and creates the links.

To create a cross-reference you need to do two things:

1. **Add an identifier** to the element you want to reference using an identifier that starts with a specific prefix

2. **Reference the element** elsewhere in your document using `@` followed by the identifier

@tbl-crossref-prefixes give examples of common elements, their prefixes and an example of adding the identifier as an attribute.
For computational outputs, like figures and tables generated from code cells, you add the identifier using the `label` code cell option.
You can see an example for a table in @sec-computational-table, a figure in @sec-computational-figure, and many more details in @sec-figtab-crossrefs.

## Citations {#sec-citations}

You can automatically generate citations and a bibliography in a number of styles. 
To do so you need: 

1.  A bibliographic data source, for example a BibLaTeX (`.bib`) or BibTeX (`.bibtex`) file.

2.   A quarto document formatted with citations (see [Citation Markdown](#sec-citations)).

Add a bibliography to your document using the `bibliography` YAML metadata field. For example:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
bibliography: references.bib
---
```

Then you can cite references from the bibliography file using their identifiers and the citation syntax described in @tbl-citation-syntax.

When you render your document, Quarto will automatically generate a bibliography at the end of your document with all cited references (@fig-references-section).

::: 

The appearance of the citations both inline and in the bibliography depends on the citation style as defined in a CSL file.
By default, Quarto use the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://chicagomanualofstyle.org/) author-date format, but you can provide a custom CSL file using the `csl` option field in your document header, for example:

``` yaml
---
title: "My Document"
bibliography: references.bib
csl: nature.csl
---
```

::: {.callout-tip}

## What's in `references.bib`?

A `.bib` file is a plain text file that contains bibliographic entries in a specific format:

```{.bib filename="references.bib"}
{{< include example.bib >}}
```

You can manage this file by hand, but usually you'll use something to manage it for you.
You could have a reference management tool of choice export to `.bib`.
Or, in the visual editor, you can use the "Add Citation" button in the toolbar.
:::

::: {.callout-note}

When using `format: typst`, by default citation processing is handled directly by Typst. See @sec-typst for more details.

::: 

## Footnotes {#sec-footnotes}

The simplest syntax for footnotes uses a carat (`^`) followed by the footnote contents:

```{.markdown .code-overflow-wrap}
Here some text that needs a footnote.^[Here is the footnote contents.]
```

However, for longer footnotes, or footnotes with multiple paragraphs, 
specify a footnote identifier and define the footnote contents elsewhere in the document,
as shown in @fig-long-footnote.

::: {#fig-long-footnote}

````{.markdown .code-overflow-wrap}
{{< include _examples/authoring/footnotes/long.md >}}
````

::: {.rendered style="text-align: left;"}
{{< include _examples/authoring/footnotes/long.md >}}
:::

## Fenced divs {#sec-fenced-divs}

**Fenced divs** are a component that Quarto uses extensively to create block-level regions of content with specific behaviors or styles.
For example:

* callout blocks (@sec-callouts) are specified as a fenced divs with a special class attribute
* a two column panel layout (@sec-layout) is specified using a fenced div with a key-value attribute, and
* you can make an element cross-referenceable with an identifier attribute that starts with a special prefix.

::: callout-tip

## What's a div?

The term **div** originates from the `<div>` tag in HTML, where it is used to define a division or region in a document.
The term **fenced div** comes from Pandoc markdown, and describes the specific markdown syntax used to create a div with a fence of colons (`:::`). 

Fenced divs provide a way to create `<div>` elements when rendering to HTML. 
But, more importantly, fenced divs are easily intercepted by Quarto.
The result is that many Quarto features use the fenced div syntax to define a region of content that needs special handling. 
Quarto recognizes these divs, processes them, and inserts suitable markup depending on the target format. 

:::

A fenced div begins with at least three consecutive colons and some, possible empty, attributes inside curly braces. 
The div ends with another line containing a string of at least three consecutive colons. 
The div should be separated by blank lines from the blocks before and after it. 
For example, here's a fenced div with no attributes:

``` markdown
::: {}
This content is inside a div with no attributes
:::
```

The attributes may include an identifier (starting with `#`), 
one or more classes (starting with `.`), and key-value pairs (`key='value'`):

``` {.markdown .code-overflow-wrap}
::: {#id .class1 .class2 key='value'}
This content is inside a div with an identifier, two classes, and a key-value attribute
:::
```

You can also nest fenced divs inside one another:

``` markdown
::::: {#id .class1 .class2 key='value'}

::: {}
Here is a warning.
:::

More content.
:::::
```

The number of colons used to open and close a fenced div do not need to match,
but it can be useful to match them for readability.

::: {.callout-tip}

## A single class shorthand

When the only attribute of a fenced div is a single class, it can be written using a shorthand syntax that omits the curly braces, and the `.` on the class name:

````markdown
::: class-name
Contents of the div.
:::
````

:::

## Callouts

Callouts are special fenced divs with one of the callout classes: `.callout-note`, `.callout-tip`, `.callout-warning`, `.callout-caution`, or `.callout-important`.
Across formats they display in a way to set their contents apart from the main document text, see @fig-callout-note.

::: {#fig-callout-note}
``` markdown
:::{.callout-note}
## Types of callout

There are five types of callouts, including: 
`note`, `tip`, `warning`, `caution`, and `important`.
:::
```

:::{style="text-align: left;"}
:::{.callout-note}
## Types of callout

There are five types of callouts, including: 
`note`, `tip`, `warning`, `caution`, and `important`.
:::
:::

Syntax and rendered output for a note callout
:::

Additional key-value attributes can be added to callouts to customize their behavior:

* `appearance`: `"default"`, `"simple"` or `"minimal"`
* `collapse`: `true` or `false`
* `icon`: `true` or `false`

See the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html) for more details.

## Layout {#sec-layout}

Laying out content on the page can also be achieved using fenced divs with specific attributes.
There are two common ways to control layout:

* Panel layouts arrange content in rows and columns using `layout-*` attributes, useful when you want elements to be side by side, or arranged in a grid.

* Column classes arrange content across different widths of the page, useful when you need to give content more horizontal space, or put elements in the margin.

### Panel layouts

Use a fenced div with the `layout-ncol` key-value attribute to arrange content in multiple columns.
It's best to be explicit about what each item is, by nesting them each in their own fenced div. 

For example, to place two items side by side in two columns, set `layout-ncol="2"` and nest each item in its own fenced div, as shown in @fig-two-column-layout.

::: {#fig-two-column-layout}

````markdown
::::: {layout-ncol="2"}
::: {}
Content for the first column.
:::

::: {}
Content for the second column
:::
:::::
````

:::{.rendered style="text-align: left;"}
::::: {layout-ncol="2"}
::: {}
Content for the first column.
:::

::: {}
Content for the second column
:::
:::::
::: 

Two-column layout syntax and rendered output
:::

The content inside each item can be any block content, including paragraphs, lists, code cells, images, or tables.
Further items will fill into new rows and Quarto will allocate vertical space as needed.
In HTML formats, the layout is responsive so that on smaller screens the items will stack vertically.

There is also `layout-nrow` attribute if you'd prefer to specify the grid by the number of rows, or for more complicated layouts a `layout` attribute. 
You can see more example using figures and tables as content in @sec-figtab-layout.

### Column classes

For `format: html` and `format: pdf`, the page is divided into a body content area and a right margin.
By default, your content will be placed in the body area.
You can override this by putting content in a fenced div and adding special `column` classes.

For example, to place content in the right margin use the `.column-margin` class:

:::{#fig-column-margin}
````markdown
::: {.column-margin}
This content will appear in the right margin.
:::
````

::: {.column-margin .rendered}
This content will appear in the right margin.
:::

Column margin syntax and rendered output
:::

Use the `.column-page-right` class to expand content into the margin to give it more horizontal space:

:::{#fig-column-page-right}
````markdown
::: {.column-page-right}
This content will expand into the right margin.
:::
````

::: {.column-page-right .rendered}
This content will expand into the right margin.
:::

Column page right syntax and rendered output
:::

Additional classes with `inset` are available to provide more horizontal whitespace, and for `format: html` columns that expand to the left, and to the full screen width.
See the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html#available-columns) for all the classes available.

You can also see more examples with figures and tables, including computational outputs in @sec-figtab-layout.

## Raw blocks 

Occasionally, you may need to directly add format specific syntax to your document.
Raw blocks provide a way to do this that protects their contents from being processed by Quarto, and omits them from formats where they aren't relevant.

A raw block begins with triple backticks followed by curly braces containing an equals sign (`=`) and the format name.
For example, you might use a raw block to add an iframe to an HTML document:

````markdown
```{=html}
<iframe src="https://example.com" width="600" height="400"></iframe>
```
````

You'll see more examples of raw blocks in @sec-output-formats.

## Shortcodes {#sec-shortcodes}

Shortcodes are special commands that are replaced with specific content when the document is rendered.
The shortcode syntax uses double curly braces and angle brackets: `{{< shortcode-name  >}}`.
The shortcode name can by followed by additional arguments or key-value pairs.

As an example, the `meta` shortcode inserts values from your document metadata  into your document.
@fig-meta-shortcode illustrates how you might use it to extract text you commonly replace, into a document option you set in your header.

::: {#fig-meta-shortcode}

```{.markdown shortcodes="false"}
---
client: "ACME Corp"
---

**Client:** {{< meta client >}}
```

:::{.rendered style="text-align: left;"}
**Client:** {{< meta client >}}
:::

You can find a list of built-in shortcodes in the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/shortcodes.html).
You can also add shortcodes via extensions (@sec-extensions).

## Includes {#sec-includes}

The `include` shortcode lets you insert the contents of another file directly into your document. 
This is useful when you want to reuse content across multiple documents or break a large document into smaller, more manageable files.

The basic syntax is:

```{.markdown}
{{{< include _content.qmd >}}}
```

Where `_content.qmd` is the path to the file you want to include, 
relative to the current document.
Files that contain content to include should be prefixed with an underscore (`_`) to ensure they are rendered on their own.

::: {.callout-tip}

## Project relative paths

If you preface the path with `/`, it is interpreted as a path relative to the project root.
You'll learn more about project structure in @sec-projects.

## Other features

* **Diagrams**: create diagrams directly in your markdown using Mermaid or Graphviz syntax---see the [Quarto diagrams documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html) for details.

## Wrapping up

This chapter has focused on how to write a rich document using Quarto markdown.
You've learned to use markdown headings to structure your document into sections, create paragraphs and lists, and format text with emphasis, links, and other inline elements. 
You've covered how to add the most important components of technical and scientific writing: code, tables, images, and equations.

You've also learned how to use key Quarto features like cross-references, citations, footnotes, and callouts.
Fenced divs let you create special regions like callouts or multi-column layouts, while shortcodes and includes help you reuse content efficiently. 
We've focused on syntax that works across multiple output formats, leaving format-specific details for later chapters—you'll likely want to return to specific sections as reference when authoring your own documents.

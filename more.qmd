Wrapping Up

Next Steps:

## Quarto books

## Quarto dashboards

Just like you can use Quarto to create documents, websites, books, etc., you can also use it to create dashboards.
The dashboards gallery <!--# TO DO: Add link --> is a great place to peruse some dashboard examples made in Quarto.
As you do so, pay attention to whether they're organized with content in columns first and then broken into rows or in rows first and then broken into columns.
This thinking process will help you design your own dashboards as well.

A Quarto dashboard is a single notebook (either `.qmd` or `.ipynb`) where `format: dashboard`.
